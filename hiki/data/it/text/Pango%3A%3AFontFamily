== Instance Methods
--- name
    Gets the name of the family. The name is unique among all fonts for the font backend and can be used in a Pango::FontDescription to specify that a face from this family is desired.
    * Returns: the name of the family.

--- monospace?
    A monospace font is a font designed for text display where the the characters form a regular grid. For Western languages this would mean that the advance width of all characters are the same, but this categorization also includes Asian fonts which include double-width characters: characters that occupy two grid cells. 
    The best way to find out the grid-cell size is to call Pango::FontMetrics#approximate_digit_width, since the results of Pango::FontMetrics#approximate_char_width may be affected by double-width characters.
    * Returns: true if the family is monospace.  

--- faces
    Gets the different font faces that make up family. The faces in a family share a common design, but differ in slant, weight, width and other aspects.
    * Returns: an Array of Pango::FontFace objects.
