== Constants
=== GConfError
--- FAILED
     Indicates that the operation fatally failed for some fairly unpredictable and idiosyncratic reason not covered by the more specific error values. The error message will give details.
--- NO_SERVER
     The gconfd configuration server could not be contacted, and we couldn't or didn't respawn it for whatever reason. The error message may give more details. This probably means either a bug in gconfd or a hosed local configuration.
--- NO_PERMISSION
    User was denied permission to access some resource at some point; perhaps a file in a file-based configuration backend, perhaps some authentication tokens are wrong. The error message will give more details.
--- BAD_ADDRESS
    A configuration source address was invalid.
--- BAD_KEY
    A configuration key was invalid.
--- PARSE_ERROR
    Something had to be parsed, and it couldn't be. Typically, a string representation of a config value found in a config file or obtained from the user. Error message will often have more details.
--- CORRUPT
    Typically means that the text files or binary database used by some backend have gotten hosed. Most backends will try to self-repair, within reason. If they can't they will bail with this error.
--- TYPE_MISMATCH
    Some routines in the GConf libraries impose type constraints; if these are violated you get this error. 
--- IS_DIR
    This error is returned if you try to perform a key operation on a name that turns out to be a directory. Some backends don't check for this error, they just report that the key isn't set...
--- IS_KEY
     This error is returned if you try to perform a directory operation on a name that turns out to be a key. Some backends don't check for this error...
--- OVERRIDDEN
    This means that you tried to set a value, and a read-only configuration source found before the first user-writable source in the path has already set the value. That is, setting the value would have no effect because the read-only source's setting would override the new value. You should report to the user that their setting will not take effect. 
--- OAF_ERROR
    liboaf error 
--- LOCAL_ENGINE
    Tried to use remote operations on a local engine 
--- LOCK_FAILED
    Failed to get a lockfile
--- NO_WRITABLE_DATABASE
    Nowhere to write a value
--- IN_SHUTDOWN
    Server is shutting down
