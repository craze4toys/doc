= class Gtk::RecentChooserWidget
Gtk::RecentChooserWidget is a widget suitable for selecting recently used files. It is the main building block of a Gtk::RecentChooserDialog. Most applications will only need to use the latter; you can use Gtk::RecentChooserWidget as part of a larger window if you have special needs.

Note that Gtk::RecentChooserWidget does not have any methods of its own. Instead, you should use the methods that work on a Gtk::RecentChooser.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.
