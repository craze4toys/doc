= Double-Clicks on a Row
{{link "tut-treeview-selection-handle", nil, "tut-treeview", "tut-treeview-selection-contextmenu"}}

Catching double-clicks on a row is quite easy and is done by connecting to a tree view's "row-activated" signal, like this:

  view.signal_connect("row-activated") do |view, path, column|
    puts "Row #{path.to_str} was clicked!"

    if iter = view.model.get_iter(path)
      puts "Double-clicked row contains name #{iter[0]}!"
    end
  end
