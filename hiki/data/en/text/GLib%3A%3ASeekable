= module GLib::Seekable

GLib::Seekable is included by streams (implementations of GLib::InputStream or
GLib::OutputStream) that support seeking. 

== Included Modules

  * GLib::Interface

== Known Implementations

     * GLib::FileIOStream
     * GLib::FileInputStream
     * GLib::FileOutputStream
     * GLib::MemoryInputStream
     * GLib::MemoryOutputStream

== Instance Methods

--- can_seek?

     Tests if the stream supports the Glib::Seekable interface.

     * Returns: true if it can be seeked, false otherwise

--- can_truncate?

     Tests if the stream can be truncated.

     * Returns: true if the stream can be truncated, false otherwise

--- seek(offset, type = GLib::SEEK_CUR, cancellable = nil)

     Seeks in the stream by the given ((|offset|)), modified by ((|type|)).

     If ((|cancellable|)) is not nil, then the operation can be cancelled by
     triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
     was cancelled,  the error GLib::IO::CancelledError will be raised.

     A GLib::IO::Error will be raised if seeking failed.

     * offset: A Fixnum or Bignum
     * type: A GLib::SeekType
     * cancellable: Optional GLib::Cancellable object, nil to ignore
     * Returns: self

--- tell

     Tells the current position within the stream.

     * Returns: The offset from the beginning of the buffer

--- truncate(offset, cancellable = nil)

     Truncates a stream with a given ((|offset|)).

     If ((|cancellable|)) is not nil, then the operation can be cancelled by
     triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
     was cancelled,  the error GLib::IO::CancelledError will be raised. If an
     operation was partially finished when the operation was cancelled the
     partial result will be returned, without an error.

     * offset: A Fixnum or Bignum
     * cancellable: Optional GLib::Cancellable object, nil to ignore
     * Returns: self
