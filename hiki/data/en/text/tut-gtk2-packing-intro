= Packing Widgets
{{link "tut-gtk-helloworld2", nil, "tut-gtk", "tut-gtk2-packing-theory"}}

When creating an application, you'll want to put more than one widget inside a window. 

Our first helloworld example only used one widget so we could simply use Gtk::Container#add to "pack" the widget 
into the window. But when you want to put more than one widget into a window, how do you control where that widget is positioned? 

This is where packing comes in.
