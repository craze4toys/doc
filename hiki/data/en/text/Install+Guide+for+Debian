== Debian GNU/Linux

=== Installing

Official packages are available for stable, testing and unstable Debian. Each binding is available as a separate package. For example,the GTK+
binding is available as libgtk2-ruby. You can install all the packages by
installing the ruby-gnome2 package, which depends on all the others. Running
"apt-get install ruby-gnome2" as root should do the trick.

Make sure you read the README.Debian file, which is available in
/usr/share/doc/<package>.

=== Bugs in Packages

Bugs in the packages should be filed as normal in the ((<Debian Bug Tracking
System|URL:http://bugs.debian.org>)).
