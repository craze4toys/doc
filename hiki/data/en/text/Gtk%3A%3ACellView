= class Gtk::CellView

A Gtk::CellView displays a single row of a Gtk::TreeModel, using cell renderers just like Gtk::TreeView. Gtk::CellView doesn't support some of the more complex features of Gtk::TreeView, like cell editing and drag and drop.

== Included Modules

== Class Methods

--- Gtk::CellView.new(text = nil, with_markup = true)

    Creates a new Gtk::CellView widget.
    * text: The text(String) to display in the cell view. If with_markup is set to true, the text is treaded as markup string.
    * with_markup: true if text is markup string, otherwise false
    * Returns: A newly created Gtk::CellView widget
    * Returns: self

--- Gtk::CellView.new(pixbuf)

    Creates a new Gtk::CellView widget, adds a Gtk::CellRendererPixbuf to it, and makes its show pixbuf.
    * pixbuf: the Gdk::Pixbuf to display in the cell view
    * Returns: A newly created Gtk::CellView widget

== Instance Methods

--- model=(model)

    Sets the Gtk::TreeModel. If the Gtk::CellView already has a model set, it will remove it before setting the new model. If model is nil, then it will unset the old model.
    * model: a Gtk::TreeModel
    * Returns: self

--- set_model(model)

    Same as Gtk::CellView#model=.
    * model: a Gtk::TreeModel
    * Returns: self

--- displayed_row

    Gets the row of the model that is currently displayed by the Gtk::CellView. See displayed_row= for more detail.
    * Returns: the Gtk::TreePath

--- displayed_row=(path)

    Sets the row of the model that is currently displayed by the Gtk::CellView. If the path is unset, then the contents of the cellview "stick" at their last value; this is not normally a desired result, but may be a needed intermediate state if say, the model for the Gtk::CellView becomes temporarily empty.
    * path: A Gtk::TreePath or nil to unset.
    * Returns: self

--- set_displayed_row(path)

    Same as Gtk::CellView#displayed_row=.
    * path: A Gtk::TreePath or nil to unset.
    * Returns: self

--- get_size_of_row(path)

    Gets the size needed by cell_view to display the model row pointed to by path. Or raise an RuntimeError if it can't get the size.
    * path: a Gtk::TreePath
    * Returns: [width, height]

--- cell_renderers

    Returns Array of the cell renderers which have been added to the Gtk::CellView.
    * Returns: Array of the cell renderers

--- background=(background)

    Sets the Background color as a String.
    * background: Background color as a String
    * Returns: background

--- set_background(background)

    Same as Gtk::CellView#background=.
    * background: Background color as a String
    * Returns: self

--- background_gdk

    Gets the Background color as a Gdk::Color.
    * Returns: Background color as a Gdk::Color

--- background_gdk=(color)

    Sets the Background color as a Gdk::Color.
    * color: Background color as a Gdk::Color
    * Returns: color

--- set_background_gdk(color)

    Same as Gtk::CellView#background_gdk=.
    * color: Background color as a Gdk::Color
    * Returns: self

--- background_set?

    Gets the value whether this tag affects the background color or not.
    * Returns: true if this tag affects the background color

--- background_set=(setting)

    Sets the value whether this tag affects the background color or not.
    * setting: true if this tag affects the background color
    * Returns: setting

--- set_background_set(setting)

    Same as Gtk::CellView#background_set=.
    * setting: true if this tag affects the background color
    * Returns: self

--- model

    Gets the  model for cell view. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * Returns: The model for cell view

--- model=(model)

    Sets the  model for cell view. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * model: The model for cell view
    * Returns: model

--- set_model(model)

    Same as model=. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * model: The model for cell view
    * Returns: self
