= How to install GConf .schemas files

Usually in order to install their .schemas files C applications include this in their Makefile:

  export GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=`gconftool-2 --get-default-source`
  gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule my.schemas

Doing the same from Ruby shouldn't be too hard.

If you are using Minero Aoki's ((<install.rb|URL:http://i.loveruby.net/en/setup.html>)) you just need to create a post-install.rb file in the main directory of your application:

  ENV['GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE'] = `gconftool-2 --get-default-source`.chomp
  Dir["schemas/*.schemas"].each do |schema|
    system("gconftool-2 --makefile-install-rule '#{schema}'")
  end

This code assumes that your .schemas files are stored in a schemas directory.
