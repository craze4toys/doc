= class Gtk::PageSetup

A Gtk::PageSetup object stores the page size, orientation
and margins. The idea is that you can get one of these from
the page setup dialog and then pass it to the
Gtk::PrittntOperation when printing. The benefit of
splitting this out of the Gtk::PrintSettings is that these
affect the actual layout of the page, and thus need to be
set long before user prints.

The margins specified in this object are the "print
margins", i.e. the parts of the page that the printer cannot
print on. These are different from the layout margins that a
word processor uses; they are typically used to determine
the minimal size for the layout margins.

To obtain a Gtk::PageSetup use Gtk::PageSetup.new to get the
defaults, or use Gtk::PrintOperation.run_page_setup_dialog to show
the page setup dialog and receive the resulting page setup.
