== Constants

=== Underline

Underline is used to specify whether text should be underlined, and if so, the type of underlining.

--- NONE

    no underline should be drawn.

--- SINGLE

    a single underline should be drawn.

--- DOUBLE

    a double underline should be drawn.

--- LOW

    a single underline should be drawn at a position beneath the ink extents of the text being underlined. This should be used only for underlining single characters, such as for keyboard accelerators. Pango::AttrUnderline::SINGLE should be used for extended portions of text.

--- ERROR

    a wavy underline should be drawn below. This underline is typically used to indicate an error such as a possilble mispelling; in some cases an contrasting color may automatically be used. ((* Since 1.4 *))
