= class Gtk::PrintOperation

Gtk::PrintOperation is the high-level, portable printing API. It looks a bit different than other GTK+ dialogs such as the Gtk::FileChooser, since some platforms don't expose enough infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such platforms, Gtk::PrintOperation uses the native print dialog. On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK+ uses its own, see Gtk::PrintUnixDialog.

The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create a Gtk::PrintOperation object with Gtk::PrintOperation.new when the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it, e.g. the page size, any Gtk::PrintSettings from previous print operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.

Then you start the print operation by calling Gtk::PrintOperation#run. It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and options. When the user finished the dialog various signals will be emitted on the Gtk::PrintOperation, the main one being ::draw-page, which you are supposed to catch and render the page on the provided Gtk::PrintContext using Cairo.

== Class Methods

--- Gtk::PrintOperation.new

     Creates a new Gtk::PrintOperation. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * Returns: a new Gtk::PrintOperation

--- Gtk::PrintOperation.run_page_setup_dialog(parent = nil, page_setup = nil, settings = nil){|page_setup| ...}

    Runs a page setup dialog, letting the user modify the values from page_setup. If the user cancels the dialog, the returned Gtk::PageSetup is identical to the passed in page_setup, otherwise it contains the modifications done in the dialog. Note that this function may use a recursive mainloop to show the page setup dialog. Use this method with a block if this is a problem. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * parent: transient parent(Gtk::Widget), or nil
    * page_setup: an existing Gtk::PageSetup, or nil
    * settings: a Gtk::PrintSettings, or nil
    * {|page_setup| ...}: Optional. This block will be called when the page setup dialog is dismissed.
      * page_setup: the Gtk::PageSetup that has been 
    * Returns: a new Gtk::PageSetup

== Instance Methods

--- cancel

     Cancels a running print operation. This function may
     be called from a begin-print, paginate or draw-page
     signal handler to stop the currently running print
     operation.((* Since 2.10 *))

--- error

     Call this when the result of a print operation is
     Gtk::PrintOperation::RESULT_ERROR, either as returned by
     Gtk::PrintOperation#run, or in the ::done signal handler.
     The returned Gtk::PrintError will contain more details on what went wrong.((* Since 2.10 *))

      * Returns: a Gtk::PrintError

--- finished?

     A convenience function to find out if the print operation
     is finished, either successfully (Gtk::PrintOperation::STATUS_FINISHED)
     or unsuccessfully (Gtk::PrintOperation::STATUS_FINISHED_ABORTED).

     Note: when you enable print status tracking the print operation
     can be in a non-finished state even after done has been called, as
     the operation status then tracks the print job status on the printer. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * Return value: true, if the print operation is finished.

--- run(action, parent = nil){|result| ... }

     Runs the print operation, by first letting the user modify
     print settings in the print dialog, and then print the
     document.

     Normally that this method does not return until the
     rendering of all pages is complete. You can connect to
     the ::status-changed signal on the operation to obtain
     some information about the progress of the print
     operation.  Furthermore, it may use a recursive
     mainloop to show the print dialog.

     If you set the allow-async property the operation will
     run asyncronously if this is supported on the
     platform. The ::done signal will be emitted with the
     operation results when the operation is done
     (i.e. when the dialog is canceled, or when the print
     succeeds or fails).

     If the result is failure, it raises an Gtk::PrintError.((* Since 2.10 *))

     * action: the action to start(Gtk::PrintOperation#Action).
     * parent: Transient parent of the dialog, or nil
     * {|result| ... }: an block (optional).
       If the block is passed, this method returns the
       return value of the block instead of the result of 
       Gtk::PrintOperation#Result. 
       * result: the result value(Gtk::PrintOperation#Result). 
         Note that ((|result|)) is set Gtk::PrintOperation::RESULT_ERROR in failure, 
         instead of raising Gtk::PrintError.
     * Returns: the result of the print
       operation. Gtk::PrintOperation#Result. A return
       value of Gtk::PrintOperation::RESULT_APPLY indicates
       that the printing was completed successfully. In this
       case, it is a good idea to obtain the used print
       settings with Gtk::PrintOperation#print_settings and store
       them for reuse with the next print operation. A value
       of Gtk::PrintOperation::RESULT_IN_PROGRESS means the
       operation is running asynchronously, and will emit
       the ::done signal when done.

== Signals

--- begin-print: self, context

     Emitted after the user has finished changing print settings
     in the dialog, before the actual rendering starts.

     A typical use for this signal is to use the parameters from the
     Gtk::PrintContext and paginate the document accordingly, and then
     set the number of pages with Gtk::PrintOperation#set_n_pages. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext for the current operation

--- create-custom-widget: self

     Emitted when displaying the print dialog. If you return a
     widget in a handler for this signal it will be added to a custom
     tab in the print dialog. You typically return a container widget
     with multiple widgets in it.

     The print dialog owns the returned widget, and its lifetime
     isn't controlled by the app. However, the widget is guaranteed
     to stay around until the custom-widget-apply signal is emitted
     on the operation. Then you can read out any information you need
     from the widgets. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * Returns: A custom widget that gets embedded in the print dialog, or nil

--- custom-widget-apply: self, widget

     Emitted right before begin-print if you added a custom
     widget in the create-custom-widget handler. When you
     get this signal you should read the information from
     the custom widgets, as the widgets are not guaraneed to
     be around at a later time. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * widget: the custom widget added in create-custom-widget

--- done: self, result

     Emitted when the print operation run has finished doing
     everything required for printing. ((|result|)) gives you information
     about what happened during the run. If @result is
     Gtk::PrintOperation::RESULT_ERROR then you can call
     gtk_print_operation_get_error() for more information.

     If you enabled print status tracking then
     Gtk::PrintOperation#finished? may still return
     false after this was emitted. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * result: the result of the print operation

--- draw-page: self, context, page_number

     Emitted for every page that is printed. The signal
     handler must render the ((|page_number|))'s page onto
     the cairo context obtained from ((|context|)) using
     Gtk::PrintContext#cairo_context.

       def draw_page(operation, context, page_number)
         cr = context.cairo_context
         width = context.width

         cr.rectangle(0, 0, width, HEADER_HEIGHT)

         cr.set_source_rgb(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)
         cr.fill

         layout = context.create_pango_layout

         desc = Pango::FontDescription.new("sans 14")
         layout.set_font_description(desc)

         layout.set_text("some text")
         layout.set_width(width)
         layout.set_alignment(Pango::ALIGN_CENTER)

         layout_width, layout_height = layout.size
         text_height = layout_height / Pango::SCALE

         cr.move_to(width / 2,  (HEADER_HEIGHT - text_height) / 2)
         cr.show_layout(layout)
       end

     Use Gtk::PrintOperation#set_use_full_page and
     Gtk::PrintOperation#set_unit before starting the print
     operation to set up the transformation of the cairo
     context according to your needs. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext for the current operation
     * page_number: the number of the currently printed page

--- end-print: self, context

     Emitted after all pages have been rendered.
     A handler for this signal can clean up any resources that have
     been allocated in the ::begin-print handler. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext for the current operation

--- paginate: self, context

     Emitted after the begin-print signal, but before the
     actual rendering starts. It keeps getting emitted until
     it returns false.

     This signal is intended to be used for paginating the
     document in small chunks, to avoid blocking the user
     interface for a long time. The signal handler should
     update the number of pages using
     Gtk::PrintOperation#set_n_pages, and return true if the
     document has been completely paginated.

     If you don't need to do pagination in chunks, you can simply do
     it all in the begin-print handler, and set the number of pages
     from there. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext for the current operation
     * Returns: true if pagination is complete

--- preview: self, preview, cointext, parent

     Gets emitted when a preview is requested from the
     native dialog.  If you handle this you must set the
     cairo context on the printing context.

     If you don't override this a default implementation
     using an external viewer will be used. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * preview: the Gtk::PrintPreviewOperation for the current operation
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext that will be used
     * parent: the Gtk::Window to use as window parent, or nil
     * Returns: true if the listener wants to take over control of the preview

--- request-page-setup: self, context, page_number, setup

     Emitted once for every page that is printed, to give
     the application a chance to modify the page setup. Any
     changes done to ((|setup|)) will be in force only for
     printing this page. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted
     * context: the Gtk::PrintContext for the current operation
     * page_number: the number of the currently printed page
     * setup: the Gtk::PageSetup

--- status-changed: self

     Emitted at between the various phases of the print
     operation.  See Gtk::PrintStatus for the phases that
     are being discriminated.  Use
     Gtk::PrintOperation#status to find out the current
     status. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * self: the Gtk::PrintOperation on which the signal was emitted

--- update-custom-widget: self

     * self: Gtk::PrintOperation: ((*FIXME*))
