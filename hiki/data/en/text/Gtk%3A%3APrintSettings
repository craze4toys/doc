= class Gtk::PrintSettings

A Gtk::PrintSettings object represents the settings of a
print dialog in a system-independent way. The main use for
this object is that once you've printed you can get a
settings object that represents the settings the user chose,
and the next time you print you can pass that object in so
that the user doesn't have to re-set all his settings.

Its also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can
easily save the settings for the next time your app runs, or
even store them in a document. The predefined keys try to
use shared values as much as possible so that moving such a
document between systems still works.

     false.

     * key: a key as String
     * Returns: true, if ((|key|)) maps to a true value.

--- get_double(key, default = nil)

     Returns the floating point number represented by the
     value that is associated with ((|key|)), ((|default|))
     or 0 (if ((|deafult|)) is nil) if the value does not
     represent a floating point number.
