== Class Methods

--- GLib::UnixMount.mount_path_system_internal?(mount_path)

     Checks if ((|mount_path|)) is considered an implementation of the OS. This
     is primarily used for hiding mountable and mounted volumes that only are
     used in the OS and has little to no relevance to the casual user. 

     * mount_path: A mount path, for example, (({/media/disk})) or (({/usr}))
     * Returns: true if ((|mount_path|)) is considered an implementation of the
       OS

--- GLib::UnixMount.at(mount_path)

     Gets a GLib::UnixMount for a given mount path.
     
     Returns: An Array containing the GLib::UnixMount and a Fixnum or Bignum
     containing a Unix timestamp for checking if the mounts have
     changed since with GLib::UnixMountPoints.changed_since?.

== Instance Methods

--- <=>

     Same as GLib::UnixMount#compare.

--- compare(other)

     Compares this Unix mount to another.

     * other: a GLib::UnixMount
     * Returns: 1, 0, or -1

--- device_path

     Gets the device path for the Unix mount.

     * Returns: A String containing the device path

--- fs_type

     Gets the filesystem type of the Unix mount.

     * Returns: A String containing the filesystem type

     * Returns: true if the Unix mount can be ejected

--- guess_icon

     Guesses the icon of the Unix mount.

     * Returns: the guessed GLib::Icon of the Unix mount

--- guess_name

     Guesses the name of the Unix mount.  The result is a translated String.

     * Returns: the guessed translated String name of the Unix mount

--- guess_should_display?

     Guesses whether or not the Unix mount should be displayed in the UI.

     * Returns: true if the Unix mount should be displayed in the UI

--- mount_path
