== Ruby-GNOME2 Win32 GUI Installer
((*Posted by Masao on 2007-02-12 (Mon) 13:12:39*))

I released the new Ruby-GNOME2 Win32 GUI Installer.

This will be replaced current win32 binary package (ruby-gtk2-x.x.x-1-i386-msvcrt-1.8.zip).
This is the alpha release. Let's try and report bugs.


== Download
((<ruby-gnome2-0.16.0-1-i386-mswin32.exe|URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=53614>))

== Features
=== Includes GTK2(gladewin32) and some other libraries.
You don't need to install gladewin32 by yourself. This must reduce almost of all installation problems and provide a easy/simple installation process.

=== Avoid DLL conflict
This installer doesn't set PATH environment forcely(as a option). And each Ruby-GNOME2 libraries find GTK2 libraries which this installer has. So this doesn't effect other GTK2 based applications which include GTK2 itself and other GTK2 libararies doesn't effect Ruby-GNOME2.
