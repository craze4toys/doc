== Changes since version 0.16.0
  * Ruby/GLib:
    * Bound functions defined since 2.14 and 2.16.
    * Improved main loop polling. **
    * Improved callback handling from non Ruby thread. **

      This changes breaks API. Sjoerd, you need to call
      rbgutil_start_callback_dispatch_thread() in your
      GStreamer bindings. Sorry.

    * Supported convenience GEnum and GFlags notation. e.g.:
        GLib::UTF8.normalize(utf8, GLib::NormalizeMode::NFD)
        ->
        GLib::UTF8.normalize(utf8, :nfd)

        key_file.load_from_data(data,
                                GLib::KeyFile::KEEP_COMMENTS |
                                GLib::KeyFile::KEEP_TRANSLATIONS)
        ->
        key_file.load_from_data(data, [:keep_contents, :keep_translations])
