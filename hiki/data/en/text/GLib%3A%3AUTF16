== Module Functions

--- GLib::UTF16.to_ucs4(utf16)

     Convert a string from UTF-16 to UCS-4. If the
     conversion is not successful, it causes
     GLib::ConvertError.

     * utf16: a UTF-16 encoded String
     * Returns: a UCS-4 encoded String

--- GLib::UTF16.to_utf8(utf16)

     Convert a string from UTF-16 to UTF-8. If the
     conversion is not successful, it causes
     GLib::ConvertError.

     Note that the input is expected to be already in native
     endianness, an initial byte-order-mark character is not
     handled specially. GLib.convert can be used to convert a
     byte buffer of UTF-16 data of ambiguous endianess.

     * utf16: a UTF-16 encoded String
     * Returns: a UTF-8 encoded String
