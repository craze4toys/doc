== Ruby/GtkTrayIcon 0.1.0
((*Posted by lrz on 2004-06-03 (Thu) 17:28:17*))

I'm pleased to announce the first release of Ruby/GtkTrayIcon, a Ruby
binding to the System Tray Protocol Specification.

This library allows Ruby developers to fill the GNOME notification
area.  It contains some code from the old EGG library, copyrighted by
Anders Carlsson.

You can download it from ((<there|URL:https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=53614&package_id=120011&release_id=243112>))

API reference is there:

((<Gtk::TrayIcon>))

Enjoy!
