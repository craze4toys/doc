= class GLib::VolumeMonitor

GLib::VolumeMonitor is for listing the user interesting devices and volumes on
the computer. In other words, what a file selector or file manager would show
in a sidebar.

GLib::VolumeMonitor is not thread-default-context aware, and so should not be
used other than from the main thread, with no thread-default-context active.
