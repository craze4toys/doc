= class GLib::UnixConnection

This is the subclass of GLib::SocketConnection that is created for Unix domain
sockets.

It contains functions to do some of the Unix socket specific functionality like
passing file descriptors.

Note that GLib::UnixConnection belongs to the Unix-specific GIO interfaces.

== Instance Methods

--- receive_fd

     Receives a file descriptor from the sending end of the connection. The
     sending end has to call GLib::UnixConnection#send_fd for this to work.

     As well as reading the fd this also reads a single byte from the stream,
     as this is required for fd passing to work on some implementations. 

     A GLib::IO::Error is raised if the file descriptor can’t be received.

     * Returns: A file descriptor

--- send_fd(fd)

     Passes a file descriptor to the recieving side of the connection. The
     recieving end has to call GLib::UnixConnection#receive_fd to accept the
     file descriptor.

     As well as sending the fd this also writes a single byte to the stream, as
     this is required for fd passing to work on some implementations. 

     A GLib::IO::Error is raised if the file descriptor can’t be sent.

     * fd: A file descriptor
     * Returns: self
