This is an easy trick, since Ruby-GNOME2 is part of the Portage system.

Just run the following command:

    emerge ruby-gnome2

Do not forget to synchronize your Portage tree before!  This can be done with this command:

    emerge sync

For more information about the Portage system, please consult the ((<Portage User Guide|URL:http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/portage-user.xml>)).
