== About GTK

(according to the ((<GTK Tutorial|URL:http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/ch-introduction.html>)))

GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can develop open software, free software, or even commercial non-free software using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or royalties.

It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK has now been used in a large number of software projects, including the GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) which is basically a wrapper around the low-level functions for accessing the underlying windowing functions (Xlib in the case of the X windows system), and gdk-pixbuf, a library for client-side image manipulation.

The primary authors of GTK are:
* Peter Mattis 
* Spencer Kimball 
* Josh MacDonald 

GTK is currently maintained by:
* Owen Taylor 
* Tim Janik 

GTK is essentially an object oriented application programmers interface (API). Although written completely in C, it is implemented using the idea of classes and callback functions (pointers to functions).

There is also a third component called GLib which contains a few replacements for some standard calls, as well as some additional functions for handling linked lists, etc. The replacement functions are used to increase GTK's portability, as some of the functions implemented here are not available or are nonstandard on other Unixes such as g_strerror(). Some also contain enhancements to the libc versions, such as g_malloc() that has enhanced debugging utilities.

In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the foundation for GTK's class hierarchy, the signal system which is used throughout GTK, a thread API which abstracts the different native thread APIs of the various platforms and a facility for loading modules.

As the last component, GTK uses the Pango library for internationalized text output.

== About Ruby-GNOME2

(according to the ((<Ruby-GNOME2 Tutorial|URL:http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.net/tut/2.0.htm>)))

Ruby is "the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programing".  It has a simple syntax exception handling features to make it easy to handle errors. The operators are syntax sugar for methods, as you can redefine them easily. Ruby is a true OOL. This means that everything in Ruby is an object. Ruby is also cross platform, and will run on many types of UNIX, DOS, Windows, Mac, etc.

The primary author of Ruby is:
* Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)

Ruby-GNOME2 is a binding for the Ruby language to use the GTK library, as well as some of the GNOME libraries. Ruby-GNOME2 provides a way to create a GUI frontend for anything you can write in Ruby.

The primary authors of Ruby-GNOME2 are:
* Masahiro Sakai
* Masao Mutoh
* Takehiro Kubo

== About this tutorial

GTK is accessible through several programming languages, such as C++, Guile, Perl, Python, TOM, Ada95, Objective C, Free Pascal, Eiffel, Java, and C#.  This document covers Ruby/GTK2, the Ruby binding for the GTK library version 2.

The reader should have some Ruby knowledge.  It would be better if he/she has some experience on X programming, but this is not required.  

This document is still under construction.  Do not hesitate to send comments or ask questions to the mailing list.  Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.
