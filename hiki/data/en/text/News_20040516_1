((*Posted by lrz on 2004-05-16 (Sun) 10:35:10*))

Ruby/GtkSourceView 0.2.0 is out.

Ruby/GtkSourceView is a Ruby binding for the GtkSourceView C library. 
It is part of the Ruby-GNOME2 project.  Ruby/GtkSourceView was initially
created by Geoff Youngs, and is now maintained by myself.

This release fixes several bugs (memory-related for some), brings more
compliance to the Ruby-GNOME2 design guidelines, wraps more
classes/methods and provides API reference documentation.
