= class GLib::Socket::MsgFlags

Flags used in GLib::Socket#receive_message and GLib::Socket#send_message. The
flags listed in the enum are some commonly available flags, but the values used
for them are the same as on the platform, and any other flags are passed in/out
as is. So to use a platform specific flag, just include the right system header
and pass in the flag.
