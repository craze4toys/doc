= module GLib::Converter

GLib::Converter is implemented by objects that convert binary data in various
ways.  The conversion can be stateful and may fail at any place.

Some example conversions are: character set conversion, compression,
decompression and regular expression replace. 

== Included Modules

  * GLib::Interface

     * GLib::CharsetConverter
     * GLib::ZlibCompressor

== Instance Methods

--- convert(input, flags = GLib::Converter::NO_FLAGS)

     ((* FIXME: This method isnâ€™t implemented correctly. *))

     Since 2.24

--- reset

     Resets all internal state in the converter, making it behave as if it was
     just created. If the converter has any internal state that would produce
     output then that output is lost.
