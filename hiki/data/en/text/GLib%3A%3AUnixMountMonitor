     GLib::UnixMountMonitor#rate_limit= to change this.

     * Returns: A new GLib::UnixMountMonitor

== Instance Methods

--- rate_limit=(limit_msec)

     Same as GLib::UnixMountMonitor#set_rate_limit.

     * Returns: ((|limit_msec|))

--- set_rate_limit(limit_msec)
     Sets the rate limit to which this mount monitor will report consecutive
     change events to the mount and mount point entry files. 

     * Returns: self
