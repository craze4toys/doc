= class Gst::Scheduler
Abstract class for objects that manage the scheduling of groups of elements.

== Object Hierarchy
* Gst::Scheduler

== Instance Methods
--- <<(something)
    Synonym for Gst::Scheduler#add.
    * something: either a Gst::Element or a Gst::Scheduler.  
    * Returns: self.

--- add(something)
    Adds either a Gst::Element or a Gst::Scheduler object inside the
    current scheduler.  In case of a scheduler object, the current scheduler
    will be notified that it has to monitor the given scheduler.
    * something: either a Gst::Element or a Gst::Scheduler.  
    * Returns: self.

--- auto_clock
    Lets the scheduler select a clock automatically.
    * Returns: self.

--- clock
    Gets the current clock used by the scheduler.
    * Returns: a Gst::Clock, or nil if no clock is set.

--- clock_wait(element, clock)
    Waits till the clock reaches a specific time.
    * clock: the Gst::Clock to use.  
    * element: the Gst::Element that wants to wait. 
    * Returns: the status of the operation (see ((<GstClockReturn|Gst::Clock#GstClockReturn>))).

--- error(element)
    Tells the scheduler an element was in error.
    * element: the Gst::Element with the error.  
    * Returns: self.

--- interrupt(element)
    Tells the scheduler to interrupt execution of this element.
    * element: the Gst::Element requesting an interrupt.  
    * Returns: true if the element should return nil from the chain/get method.

--- iterate
    Performs one iteration on the scheduler.
    * Returns: a boolean indicating something useful has happened.

--- lock_element(element)
    Acquires a lock on the given element in the current scheduler.
    * element: the Gst::Element to lock.  
    * Returns: self.

--- pad_link(srcpad, sinkpad)
    Links the given source pad to the given sink pad.
    * sinkpad: the sink Gst::Pad to link to.  
    * srcpad: the source Gst::Pad to link. 
    * Returns: self.

--- pad_select(*pads)
    Registers the given list of pads for a select operation.
    * pads: a set of Gst::Pad objects to select on.  
    * Returns: the Gst::Pad which received a buffer.

--- pad_unlink(srcpad, sinkpad)
    Unlinks the given source pad from the given sink pad.
    * sinkpad: the sink Gst::Pad to unlink from.  
    * srcpad: the source Gst::Pad to unlink. 
    * Returns: self.

--- remove(something)
    Removes either a Gst::Element or a Gst::Scheduler object inside the
    current scheduler.  In case of a scheduler object, the current scheduler
    will be notified that it has to stop monitoring the given scheduler.
    * something: either a Gst::Element or a Gst::Scheduler.  
    * Returns: self.

--- reset 
    Resets the scheduler.
    * Returns: self.

--- scheduling_change(element) 
    Tells the scheduler that an element changed its scheduling strategy. 
    An element could, for example, change its loop function or changes from a 
    loop based element to a chain based element.
    * element: the Gst::Element that changed its scheduling strategy.  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_clock(clock)
    Sets the clock for the scheduler. The clock will be distributed to all the 
    elements managed by the scheduler.
    * clock: the Gst::Clock to set.  
    * Returns: self.

--- setup
    Prepares the scheduler.
    * Returns: self.

--- show
    Dumps the state of the scheduler.
    * Returns: self.

--- state
    Gets the current state of the scheduler.
    * Returns: the current state (see Gst::Scheduler::State).

--- unlock_element(element)
    Releases the lock on the given element in the current scheduler.
    * element: the Gst::Element to unlock.  
    * Returns: self.

--- use_clock(clock)
    Forces the scheduler to use the given clock. The scheduler will always use 
    the given clock even if new clock providers are added to this scheduler.
    * clock: the Gst::Clock to set.  
    * Returns: self.

--- yield(element)
    Tells the scheduler to schedule another element.
    * element: the Gst::Element requesting a yield.  
    * Returns: true if the element should save its state, false if the scheduler can perform this action itself.
