= class Pango::EngineLang
The Pango::EngineLang class is implemented by engines that customize the rendering-system independent part of the Pango pipeline for a particular script or language. For instance, a custom Pango::EngineLang could be provided for Thai to implement the dictionary-based word boundary lookups needed for that language.
