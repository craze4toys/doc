Ruby/Libgda is part of the Ruby-GNOME2 project.  Please consult one of our ((<install guides|Install Guide>)) for more details about Ruby-GNOME2 installation.

Obviously, Ruby/Libgda depends of the libgda library, available from the ((<GNOME DB project|URL:http://www.gnome-db.org/>)).  You can browse the ((<"'Installing' section"|URL:http://www.gnome-db.org/docs/libgda/installation-installing.html>)) of their manual.

Please check that you built all needed GDA providers.
