== Instance Methods

--- layout_style

    Retrieves the method being used to arrange the buttons in a button box. 
    * Returns: Gtk::ButtonBox#Style. the method used to layout buttons in widget.

--- layout_style=(style)

    Changes the way buttons are arranged in their container. 
    * style: Gtk::ButtonBox#Style. the new layout style.  
    * Returns: style

--- set_layout_style(style)

    Same as Gtk::ButtonBox#layout_style=.
    * layout_style : the new layout style.  
    * Returns: self

--- set_child_secondary(child, is_secondary)

    Sets whether child should appear in a secondary group of children. A typical use of a secondary child is the help button in a dialog. 
    This group appears after the other children if the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::START, Gtk::ButtonBox::SPREAD or Gtk::ButtonBox::EDGE, and before the the other children if the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::END. 
    For horizontal button boxes, the definition of before/after depends on direction of the widget (see Gtk::Widget#set_direction). If the style is Gtk::ButtonBox::START or Gtk::ButtonBox::END, then the secondary children are aligned at the other end of the button box from the main children. For the other styles, they appear immediately next to the main children.
     * child: a child of widget (Gtk::Widget)  
     * is_secondary : if true, the child appears in a secondary group of the button box.
     * Returns: self

--- get_child_secondary(child)

    Returns whether child should appear in a secondary group of children. ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * child: a child of widget (Gtk::Widget)
    * Returns: true if the child should appear in a secondary group of children.
