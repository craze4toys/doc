= class GLib::UnixFDMessage

This GLib::SocketControlMessage contains a GLib::UnixFDList. It may be sent
using GLib::Socket#send_message and received using GLib::Socket#receive_message
over Unix sockets (that is, sockets in the GLib::Socket::ADDRESS_UNIX family).
The file descriptors are copied between processes by the kernel.

For an easier way to send and receive file descriptors over stream-oriented
Unix sockets, see GLib::UnixConnection#send_fd and
GLib::UnixConnection#receive_fd.

Note that GLib::UnixFDMessage belongs to the Unix-specific GIO interfaces.

== Object Hierarchy

* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * GLib::SocketControlMessage
        * GLib::UnixFDMessage

== Class Methods

--- GLib::UnixFDMessage.new(fd_list)

     Creates a new GLib::UnixFDMessage containing ((|fd_list|))

     * Returns: a new GLib::UnixFDMessage

== Instance Methods

--- <<(fd)

     Same as GLib::UnixFDMessage#append_fd.

--- append_fd(fd)

     Adds a file descriptor to message.

     The file descriptor is duplicated using dup(). You keep your copy of the
     descriptor and the copy contained in message will be closed when message
     is finalized.

     A possible cause of failure is exceeding the per-process or system-wide
     file descriptor limit. 

     A GLib::IO::Error is raised if the file descriptor canâ€™t be duplicated.

     * Returns: self

--- fd_list

    Gets the GLib::UnixFDList object to send with the message.

     * Returns: The GLib::UnixFDList object to send with the message

--- steal_fds

     Returns the Array of file descriptors that is contained in this object.

     After this call, the descriptors are no longer contained in message.
     Further calls will return an empty Array (unless more descriptors have been
     added).

     The caller is responsible for closing all of the file descriptors.

     * Returns: An Array of file descriptors

== Properties

--- fd-list: GLib::UnixFDList (Read/Write)

    The GLib::UnixFDList object to send with the message
