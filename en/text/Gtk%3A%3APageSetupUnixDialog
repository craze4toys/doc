= class Gtk::PageSetupUnixDialog

A page setup dialog.

Gtk::PageSetupUnixDialog implements a page setup dialog for
platforms which don't provide a native page setup dialog,
like Unix. It can be used very much like any other GTK+
dialog, at the cost of the portability offered by Gtk::PrintOperation.
