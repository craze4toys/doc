== What is IRC?

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.  It is a very popular Internet service allowing people all over the world 
to participate in real-time conversations.

== How can I join?

Just start the following commands in your favorite IRC client:

  /server irc.gnome.org
  /join #ruby-gnome2

Thus, type something to join the conversation.

== IRC clients

If you don't have one already, you must install an IRC client to connect to #ruby-gnome2.

Here are some popular IRC clients:

:((<"X-Chat"|URL:http://www.xchat.org>))
 A GTK2-based IRC Client, recommended for its simplicity.

Unfortunate Microsoft Windows users should use ((<mIRC|URL:http://www.mirc.com>)) (be careful since it's a closed-source software, with some security issues).  For those that don't require maintained software, try ((<XiRCON|URL:http://www.xircon.com/>)) instead.
