== Constants

Defines how a Unicode string is transformed in a canonical
form, standardizing such issues as whether a character with
an accent is represented as a base character and combining
accent or as a single precomposed character. Unicode strings
should generally be normalized before comparing them.

--- DEFAULT

     standardize differences that do not affect the text
     content, such as the above-mentioned accent
     representation.

--- NFD

     another name for GLib::NormalizeMode::DEFAULT.

--- DEFAULT_COMPOSE

     like GLib::NormalizeMode::DEFAULT, but with composed forms
     rather than a maximally decomposed form.

--- NFC

     another name for GLib::NormalizeMode::DEFAULT_COMPOSE.

--- ALL

     beyond GLib::NormalizeMode::DEFAULT also standardize the
     "compatibility" characters in Unicode, such as
     SUPERSCRIPT THREE to the standard forms (in this case
     DIGIT THREE). Formatting information may be lost but
     for most text operations such characters should be
     considered the same.

--- NFKD

     another name for GLib::NormalizeMode::ALL.

--- ALL_COMPOSE

     like GLib::NormalizeMode::ALL, but with composed forms rather
     than a maximally decomposed form.

--- NFKC

     another name for GLib::NormalizeMode::ALL_COMPOSE
