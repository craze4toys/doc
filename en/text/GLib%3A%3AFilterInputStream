= class GLib::FilterInputStream

Base class for input stream implementations that perform some kind of filtering
operation on a base stream. Typical examples of filtering operations are
character set conversion, compression and byte order flipping.

== Instance Methods

--- base_stream

     Gets the underlying base stream on which the I/O operations will be done.

     * Returns: The underlying base stream on which the I/O operations will be done

--- close_base_stream=(close_base_stream)

     Same as GLib::FilterInputStream#set_close_base_stream.
     Returns: ((|close_base_stream|))

--- close_base_stream?

     Checks if the base stream should be closed when the filter stream is closed.

     * Returns: true if the base stream should be closed when the filter stream
       is closed

--- set_close_base_stream(close_base_stream)

     Sets whether or not the base stream should be closed when the filter
     stream is closed.

     * close_base_stream: true if the base stream should be closed when the
       filter stream is closed
     * Returns: self

== Properties

--- base-stream: GLib::InputStream (Read/Write)

     The underlying base stream on which the I/O operations will be done.

--- close-base-stream: true or false (Read/Write)

     Whether or not the base stream should be closed when the filter stream is
     closed.
