= class Gtk::Ruler

The Gtk::Ruler widget is a base class for horizontal and vertical rulers. Rulers are used to show the mouse pointer's location in a window. The ruler can either be horizontal or vertical on the window. Within the ruler a small triangle indicates the location of the mouse relative to the horizontal or vertical ruler. See Gtk::HRuler to learn how to create a new horizontal ruler. See Gtk::VRuler to learn how to create a new vertical ruler. 

((*Note*))

This widget is considered too specialized/little-used for GTK+, and will in the future be moved to some other package. If your application needs this widget, feel free to use it, as the widget does work and is useful in some applications; it's just not of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features for the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+ distribution.

== Instance Methods

--- metric

    Gets the metric. See metric= for more details.
    * Returns: the unito of measurement ((<GtkMetricType|Gtk#GtkMetricType>))

--- metric=(metric)

    This calls the ((<GtkMetricType|Gtk#GtkMetricType>)) to set the ruler to units defined. Available units are Gtk::PIXELS, Gtk::INCHES, or Gtk::CENTIMETERS. The default unit of measurement is Gtk::PIXELS. 
    * metric: the unit of measurement.  ((<GtkMetricType|Gtk#GtkMetricType>))
    * Returns: metric

--- set_metric(metric)

    Same as Gtk::Ruler#metric=.
    * metric: the unit of measurement.  ((<GtkMetricType|Gtk#GtkMetricType>))
    * Returns: self

--- range

    Retrieves values indicating the range and current position of a Gtk::Ruler. See Gtk::Ruler#range=.
    * [lower, upper, position, max_size]
       * lower: lower limit of the ruler  
       * upper: upper limit of the ruler  
       * position: the current position of the mark on the ruler  
       * max_size: the maximum size of the ruler used when calculating the space to leave for the text
    * Returns: self

--- set_range(lower, upper, position, max_size)

    This sets the range of the ruler using Float lower, Float upper, Float position, and Float max_size. 
    * lower: the upper limit of the ruler (Float)
    * upper: the lower limit of the ruler (Float)  
    * position: the mark on the ruler  (Float)
    * max_size: the maximum size of the ruler  (Float) 
    * Returns: self

--- draw_pos

    Draw the position mark on the ruler. This method is not used by applications.
    * Returns: self

--- draw_ticks

    Draw the tick marks on the ruler. This method is not used by applications.

    * Returns: max_size

--- set_max_size(max_size)

    Same as Gtk::Ruler#max_size=.
    * max_size: Maximum size of the ruler(Float)
    * Returns: self

--- position

    Gets the Position of mark on the ruler.
    * Returns: Position of mark on the ruler(Float)

--- position=(position)

    Sets the Position of mark on the ruler.
    * position: Position of mark on the ruler(Float)
    * Returns: position

--- set_position(position)

    Same as Gtk::Ruler#position=.
    * position: Position of mark on the ruler(Float)
    * Returns: self

--- upper

    * Returns: Upper limit of ruler(Float)

--- upper=(upper)

    Sets the Upper limit of ruler.
    * upper: Upper limit of ruler(Float)
    * Returns: upper
