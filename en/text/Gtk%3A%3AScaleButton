= class Gtk::ScaleButton

Gtk::ScaleButton provides a button which pops up a scale widget if clicked.
This scale widget then allows you to set its value.

Gtk::ScaleButton is commonly used for volume controls in multimedia applications.

To respond to a changed value:
  scale_button = Gtk::ScaleButton.new(Gtk::IconSize::BUTTON) 
  scale_button.signal_connect(:value_changed) { |widget, value| puts "value changed: #{value}" }
