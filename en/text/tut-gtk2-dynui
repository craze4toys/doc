By now you have learnt a great deal about GTK+ and its supporting libraries and are able to create fairly complex applications. However, manually writing all of the code to create and configure the the widgets and behaviour for these applications can quickly become tedious. The Glade User Interface builder removes the need for you to write all that code by allowing you to design your UI graphically. It supports the GTK+ library of widgets as well as various widgets from GNOME libraries. User interfaces are saved as XML files, which can be  used to dynamically build your application's user interface.

The last part of this chapter covers Libglade, a library that can be used to dynamically load the XML files. Libglade will crate all of the necessary widgets and allow you to connect any signals defined in Glade.

:In this chapter you will learn:

    * How to design custom graphical user interface with Glade
    * How to dynamically load Glade user interfaces with Libglade

    If you are running examples while reading this tutorial, you will need Glade and Libglade installed on your system. On most Linux systems you will be able to install it from your Software Package Managers, on Windows check out the ((<gladewin32|URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/gladewin32>)). Once you have Glade installed check also out: ((<"Ruby/Libglade">)).
