== Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and 8.04 (Hardy Heron)

=== Installation 
Since the latest bindings are already part of Gutsy, the only thing for you to do is to install them!

If you chose the meta package ruby-gnome2 you are going to install the complete set of bindings. Programmers should additionally install the Ruby-GNOME2 class browser rbbr, which afterwards should be updated with the latest ((<nightly tarball|URL:http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/data/ruby-gnome2-api.tar.gz>)). To do so, simply move the content of the unpacked folder to /usr/share/rbbr/rd. Unless you need the Japanese version, you should delete the folder ja for it could prevent some documentation to appear.

Have fun!
