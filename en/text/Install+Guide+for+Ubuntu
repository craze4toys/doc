== Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and 8.04 (Hardy Heron)

=== Installation 

Since the latest bindings are already part of both Hardy and Gutsy, the only thing for you to do is to install them!

Selecting and installing the meta-package "ruby-gnome2" ensures that the complete set of the Ruby-GNOME2-bindings is going to be installed. Programmers should additionally install the Ruby-GNOME2 class browser rbbr, which afterwards should be updated with the latest ((<nightly tarball|URL:http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/data/ruby-gnome2-api.tar.gz>)). Simply move the content of the unpacked folder to /usr/share/rbbr/rd. Unless you need the Japanese version, you should delete the folder "ja".


Have fun!
