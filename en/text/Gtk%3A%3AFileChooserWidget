= class Gtk::FileChooserWidget
Gtk::FileChooserWidget is a widget suitable for selecting files. It is the main building block of a Gtk::FileChooserDialog. Most applications will only need to use the latter; you can use Gtk::FileChooserWidget as part of a larger window if you have special needs. 

Note that Gtk::FileChooserWidget does not have any methods of its own. Instead, you should use the methods that work on a Gtk::FileChooser.
