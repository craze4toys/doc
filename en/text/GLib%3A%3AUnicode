== Module Functions

--- GLib::Unicode.canonical_ordering(ucs4)

     Computes the canonical ordering of a string. This
     rearranges decomposed characters in the string
     according to their combining classes. See the Unicode
     manual for more information.

     * ucs4: a UCS-4 encoded String
     * Returns: the canonical ordering of ((|ucs4|))

--- GLib::Unicode.canonical_decomposition(unichar)

     Computes the canonical decomposition of a Unicode
     character.

     * unichar: a Unicode character as Integer
     * Returns: a string of Unicode characters.

=== BreakType

These are the possible line break classifications. The five
Hangul types were added in Unicode 4.1, so, has been
introduced in GLib 2.10. Note that new types may be added in
the future. Applications should be ready to handle unknown
values. They may be regarded as
GLib::Unicode::BreakType::UNKNOWN. See
