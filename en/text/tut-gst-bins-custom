= Custom Bins
{{link("tut-gst-bins-add", nil, "tut-gst", "tut-gst-bins-ghost-pads")}}

The application programmer can create custom bins packed with elements to perform a specific task. 

This allows you to write an MPEG audio decoder with just the following lines of code:

  # create the mp3player element
  player = Gst::ElementFactory.make("mp3player")

  # set the source mp3 file
  player.location = "helloworld.mp3"

  # start playback
  player.play

  ...

  # pause playback
  player.pause

  ...

  # stop
  player.stop

Note that the above code assumes that the mp3player bin derives itself from a Gst::Thread, which begins to play as soon as its state is set to Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING. Other bin types may need explicit iteration.  For more information, see the chapter called Threads.
