== Not a button but vaguely related Button Box

As the title above suggests this widget does not really belong between the buttons, however there are a few features included with it that prompted its inclusion in this batch of sessions dealing with buttons. 
 
 Gtk::Bin
 |   Gtk::Window
 |   |   Gtk::Button
 |   |   |   Gtk::ToggleButton
 |   |   |   |   Gtk::CheckButton
 |   |   |   |   |   Gtk::RadioButton
 |   |   |   Gtk::ColorButton
 |   |   |   Gtk::FontButton
 |   |   |   Gtk::LinkButton
 |   |   |   Gtk::OptionMenu
 |   |   |   Gtk::ScaleButton
 |   |   |   |   Gtk::VolumeButton
 Gtk::Box
 |   Gtk::ButtonBox
 |   |   Gtk::HButtonBox
 |   |   Gtk::HButtonBox

The above hierarchy clearly shows two distinct hierarchies. What makes the two related is the fact that these boxes are used to pack buttons. The primary purpose of Gtk::ButtonBox class is to keep track of the various properties of Gtk::HButtonBox and Gtk::VButtonBox widgets. 

Once a button box is created with either Gtk::HButtonBox.new or Gtk::HButtonBox.new, you may be required to set up the layout style for the buttons within the box. You accomplish this with the following methods:

* Gtk::ButtonBox#layout_style - Retrieves the method being used to arrange the buttons in a button box.
* Gtk::ButtonBox#layout_style=(style) - Changes the way buttons are arranged in their container.
* Gtk::ButtonBox#set_layout_style(style) - Same as Gtk::ButtonBox#layout_style=.

In the above method calls the style argument will be one of the following:

--- Gtk::ButtonBox Style

  Used to dictate the style that a Gtk::ButtonBox uses to layout the buttons it contains.

  * DEFAULT_STYLE -  Default packing.
  * SPREAD - Buttons are evenly spread across the Gtk::ButtonBox.
  * EDGE - Buttons are placed at the edges of the Gtk::ButtonBox.
  * START - Buttons are grouped towards the start of box, (on the left for a Gtk::HBox, or the top for a Gtk::VBox).
  * END - Buttons are grouped towards the end of a box, (on the right for a Gtk::HBox, or the bottom for a Gtk::VBox).
  * CENTER 

Finally you have add buttons with Gtk::ButtonBox#add_child (See Gtk::Buildable#add_child).
