= module Gtk::Buildable

== Description

In order to allow construction from a ((<Gtk::Builder UI
description|Gtk::Builder UI Description>)), an object class
must implement the Gtk::Buildable interface. The interface
includes methods for setting names and properties of
objects, parsing custom tags, constructing child objects.

The Gtk::Buildable interface is implemented by all widgets
and many of the non-widget objects that are provided by
GTK+. The main user of this interface is Gtk::Builder, there
should be very little need for applications to call any
Gtk::Buildable's functions.

== Instance Methods

--- add_child(builder, child, type)

     * child: child to add
     * type: kind of child or nil
     * Returns: self

--- construct_child(builder, name)

    Constructs a child of self with the name ((|name|)).

    Gtk::Builder calls this function if a "constructor" has
    been specified in the UI definition.

     * builder: Gtk::Builder used to construct this object
     * name: name of child to construct
     * Returns: the constructed child

--- get_internal_child(builder, child_name)

    Get the internal child called ((|child_name|)) of the buildable object.

     * builder: a Gtk::Builder
     * child_name: name of child
     * Returns: the internal child of self

--- name

    Gets the name of self.

    Gtk::Builder sets the name based on the ((<Gtk::Builder
    UI definition|Gtk::Builder UI Definition>)) used to
    construct self.

     * Returns: the name set with Gtk::Buildable#name=

--- name=(name)

    Sets the name of self.

     * name: name to set.
     * Returns: name

--- set_buildable_property(builder, name, value)

    Sets the property name ((|name|)) to ((|value|)) on the object.

     * builder: Gtk::Builder.
     * name: name of property as String.
     * value: value of property.
