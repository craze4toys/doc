== Dialogues With Multiple Pages Using Gtk_Assistant

As of GTK+ 2.10, a new widget called Gtk_Assistant was introduced. This widget enables you to create dialogues with multiple stages, which split otherwise complex dialogues into steps that guide the user. You may have encountered these kinds of dialogues in various application as wizardss.

This example begins by giving the user general information. The next page contains the entry field and will not allow the user to proceed until some text is entered, the third page will not allow to continue until the check button is selected. The fourth page should activate the forward button after progress bar is filled. and the last page gives the summary of what happened. This is a general flow that every Gtk::Assistant widget should follow.

=== Creating Gtk::Assistant Pages

A Gtk::Assistant widget is a dialogue with multiple pages. However it is not derived from Gtk::Dialog. You create an empty Gtk::Assistant widget with Gtk::Assistant.new. There is no actual page widget for assistants, because each page is actually a child widget that is added by either Gtk::Assistant.append_page, Gtk::Assistant.prepend_page or Gtk::Assistant.insert_page. These methods accept a child widget that is going to became the the content of the page, returning an index (starting at 0) of the new page.

:Page Properties:
    Each page has a number of optional properties that can be set:
    * Page title : - Every page should have a title, so that user knows what it is for.
    * Headet image : - In the top panel, left to the title you can display an optional image.
    * Side image : - This image can optionally be displayed along the left side of the assistant beside the page content.
    * Page type : - The page type must always be set to one of the following four Gtk::Assistant#PageType types:
      * PAGE_CONTENT : - The page has regular contents.
      * PAGE_INTRO : - The page contains an introduction to the assistant task.
      * PAGE_CONFIRM : - The page lets the user confirm or deny the changes.
      * PAGE_SUMMARY : - The page informs the user of the changes done.
      * PAGE_PROGRESS : - Used for tasks that take a long time to complete, blocks the assistant until the page is marked as complete.
      NOTE: If fou do not set the last page type as Gtk::Assistant::PAGE_CONFIRM or Gtk::Assistant::PAGE_SUMMARY, your application will fail.

Since Gtk::Assistant is not derived from Gtk::Dialog, you can not call Gtk::Dialog#run or any other Gtk::Dialog methods on this widget. Instead the following four signals are provided:
* apply : - Emited when either Apply or Forward button is clicked
* cancel : - Emited when Cancel button is clicked
* close : - Emited when either Apply or Close button is clicked
* prepare : - Before making the new page visible this signal is emitted so that you can do any preparation work before you make it available for the user to see.

NOTE: you can still connect the widgets you have added as content to any signals they emit.

On every page, a Cancel button is displayed in addition to few other buttons. Forward button is inactive if the page is set as incomplete. By default, every page is set as incomplete. You have to set it to complete by calling Gtk::Assistant#set_page_complete(page, boolean). In the example program the first and last pages were originally set as complete since they were merely informative. More interesting are the pages 2 through 4 on our example. On the second page we made page complete only after the user has modified the entry field - this is monitored via the Gtk::Editable ((*changed*)) signal. Similarly user can move forward only after toggling the check button.  The fourth page is particularly interesting because it contains two widgets we need to manipulate (1) button click and (2) progress bar. It is important to see that the progress bar widget has to be passed into the callback method so it can manipulate it! (We will have more to say about the progress bar shortly.) Also the type of this page is set to Gtk::Assistant::PAGE_PROGRESS, which disables all actions until the page is complete. This means the loop running progress bar must finish before the page is set to complete.


=== Page Forward Functions 

There are times that you may want to skip to a specific assistant pages if conditions require so. For example let us assume that you are writing a bilingual instructions and you want the assistant to jump to the selected language pages. For this to work you'd have to disable the normal Gtk::Assistant's page forwarding schema and implement your own algorithm. You do this by the method Gtk::Assistant#set_forward_page_func{|current_page| ...}:

--- set_forward_page_func{|current_page| ...}

    Sets the page forwarding method to be block, this
    method will be used to determine what will be the next page
    when the user presses the forward button. Setting page_func
    to nil will make the assistant to use the default forward
    function, which just goes to the next visible page. 

    * {|current_page| ... }: the page forwarding block 
      * current_page: passed argument is the page number used to calculate the next page
      * Returns: the next page number
    * Returns: self

In the block you would set the page with Gtk::Assistant#current_page=(page_num)
--- current_page=(page_num)

    Switches the page to page_num. Note that this will only be
    necessary in custom buttons, as the assistant flow can be set
    with Gtk::Assistant#set_forward_page_func.
    ((*Since 2.10*))

    * page_num: index of the page to switch to, starting from 0.
      If negative, the last page will be used. If greater than
      the number of pages in the assistant, nothing will be done.
    * Returns: page_num

{{image_right("dialog-warning.png")}}
Though, (as of  Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby-GNOME2 rel 2-0.17.0-rc1) I believe there is  currently a problem with the way "Gtk::Assistant#set_forward_page_func" as well as "Gtk::Assistant#current_page=" are implemented in Ruby GTK+. The following program snippet will give you an idea how your own customized forwarding behaviour should be implemented within an assistant object, providing there were no problems with your Gtk::Assistant Ruby implementation:

 assistant.set_forward_page_func do |curr_pg|
   case curr_pg
   when 0 then assistant.current_page = 1
   when 1 then assistant.current_page = (japanese?) ? 2 : 3
   when 2 then assistant.current_page = 5
   when 3 then assistant.current_page = 4
   end
 end

Also it is not clear to me how to set set_forward_page_func to nil, as suggested in Gtk::Assistant API documentation. Perhaps the author meant ((*undef*)), which also may raise suspicious scenarios if one would attempt to undef the very method, in which undef is issued, itself.



== Progress Bar

Gtk::ProgressBar widgets are a simple way to show the progression of a certain task performed by your program. They provide a user with a visual clue, that their program is actually working and is not frozen.

New simpler progress bar implementation was made available as of GTK+ 2.0, so be careful when reading the API documentation, because  a number of methods and properties are depreciated. 

In the program above there are many new concepts and the focus is on the Gtk::Assistant so it is not very convenient to study how the progression bar is implemented. Nevertheless, one thing to pay attention to is how the adjustments are connected with the widgets they relate to. We have seen part of this story already when we learnt about spin buttons. However, it was more clear how to bind the adjustment and spin button there, because the Gtk::SpinButton.new method expected the adjustment object (see: ((<Spin Buttons - Adjutments|tut-gtk2-numtxt-spinbttns#Adjustments>))).

 Gtk::SpinButton.new(adjustment, climb_rate, digits)

But in our examples here you can see that you need to associate the adjustment and the progression bar yourself with the ((*add*)) method. When you have multiple containers like in our example program, this becomes even more tricky. Compare the above program with the next simple progress bar example.

 align = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
 pbar = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 align.add(pbar)
   ...
 hbox.pack_start_defaults(align)

{{image_right("dialog-progressbar-02.png")}}

Following program deals only with the progress bar and is included here only to study the relationship between the adjustment and the progression bar. However since the progress bar's main purpose is to run along with some other time consuming procedure you should be aware that that piece of code is not included here.

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 require 'gtk2'

 # Fill up the progress bar, 10% every second when the button
 # is clicked.
 def button_clicked (button, progress)
   percent = 0.0
   button.sensitive = false;

   while(percent <= 100.0)
     progress.text = "%.0f%% Complete" % percent
     progress.fraction = percent / 100.0
     while (Gtk.events_pending?)
       Gtk.main_iteration
     end
     sleep 0.1
     percent += 5.0
   end
   button.sensitive = true;
 end

 window = Gtk::Window.new(Gtk::Window::TOPLEVEL)
 window.resizable = true
 window.set_title  "Progress Bar"
 window.border_width = 10
 window.signal_connect('delete_event') { Gtk.main_quit }
 window.set_size_request(-1, -1)

 align = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
 pbar = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 align.add(pbar)

 button = Gtk::Button.new("Click me!")
 button.signal_connect('clicked') { |w| button_clicked(w, pbar) }

 hbox = Gtk::HBox.new(false, 5)
 hbox.border_width = 10

 hbox.pack_start(align, false, false, 5)
 hbox.pack_start(button, false, false, 5)

 window.add(hbox)
 window.show_all

=== More elaborate Progress Bar Example

{{image_left("dialog-progressbar-03.png")}}

Following is a more elaborate progress bar program from the original Japanese page. It also implements threads, which we have not seen so far. Nevertheless I want you to run and test out this program, because it shows interesting different features that Gtk::ProgressBar offers.

Interesting is the activity_mode which if set to true turns the Gtk::Progress into activity mode, meaning that it signals something is happening, but not how much of the activity is finished. This is used when you're doing something that you don't know how long it will take. The activity mode determines how the progress bar is manipulated, namely either as ((*pulse*)) or as ((*fraction*)).

{{br}}

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 require 'gtk2'

 window = Gtk::Window.new
 window.resizable = true
 window.title = "Gtk::ProgressBar"
 window.border_width = 0

 vbox = Gtk::VBox.new(false, 5)
 vbox.border_width = 10
 window.add(vbox)

 align = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)
 vbox.pack_start(align, false, false, 5)

 pbar = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 align.add(pbar)

 separator = Gtk::HSeparator.new
 vbox.pack_start(separator, false, false, 0)

 table = Gtk::Table.new(2, 3, false)
 table.row_spacings = 5
 table.border_width = 5
 vbox.pack_start(table, false, true, 0)

 check = Gtk::CheckButton.new("Show text")
 table.attach_defaults(check, 0, 1, 0, 1)
 check.signal_connect("clicked") {pbar.text = pbar.text ? nil : "some text"}

 check = Gtk::CheckButton.new("Activity mode")
 table.attach_defaults(check, 0, 1, 1, 2)
 check.signal_connect("clicked") do
   pbar.activity_mode = !pbar.activity_mode?
   if pbar.activity_mode?
     pbar.pulse
   else
     pbar.fraction = 0.0
   end
 end

 check = Gtk::CheckButton.new("Right to Left")
 table.attach_defaults(check, 0, 1, 2, 3)
 check.signal_connect("clicked") do
   case pbar.orientation
   when Gtk::ProgressBar::LEFT_TO_RIGHT
     pbar.orientation = Gtk::ProgressBar::RIGHT_TO_LEFT
   when Gtk::ProgressBar::RIGHT_TO_LEFT
     pbar.orientation = Gtk::ProgressBar::LEFT_TO_RIGHT
   end
 end

 button = Gtk::Button.new("close")
 button.signal_connect("clicked") {window.destroy}
 vbox.pack_start(button, false, false, 0)
 button.can_default = true
 button.grab_default

 window.show_all
 thread = Thread.start do
   loop {
     if pbar.activity_mode?
       pbar.pulse
     else
       new_val = pbar.fraction + 0.01
       new_val = 0.0 if new_val > 1.0
       pbar.fraction = new_val
     end
     sleep 0.1

= A word of caution about an adjustment and a progress bar

I believe currently (Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby-GNOME2 rel 2-0.17.0-rc1), there is something immature about the way assignment of a Gtk::ProgressBar and a Gtk::Alignment is implemented. You saw that you need to associate the adjustment and the progress bar yourself with the ((*add*)) method. Yet there exists no clear definition about this relationship, moreover in different situations it seems it done differently. Let us look again at this association between the adjustment and the progress bar in the simple scenario where the only widget you are dealing with is the progress bar packed away into a Gtk::HBox.

 align = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
 pbar = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 align.add(pbar)
   ...
 hbox.pack_start_defaults(align)

When you have multiple containers like in our example program, this becomes more tricky.


 page[3].widget = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
 ...
 # Create the necessary widgets for the fourth page.
 # Then, attach the progress bar to the GtkAlignment
 # widget for later access.
 button = Gtk::Button.new("Click me!")
 progress = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 hbox = Gtk::HBox.new(false, 5)
 hbox.pack_start(progress, true, false, 5)
 hbox.pack_start(button,   false, false, 5)
 page[3].widget.add(hbox) 

However, even more disturbing is the fact that if you carefully study the two program snippets here, taken from the above example programs, you can see that in each the alignment and the progress bar are assigned to each other in a different way, and that if you want to turn the order around to make the two more similar that would not work. For instance the following code that more closely mimics the first (simpler) code snippet does not work:

 page[3].widget = Gtk::Alignment.new(0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0)
 progress = Gtk::ProgressBar.new
 page[3].widget.add(progress)
 ...
 # Create the necessary widgets for the fourth page.
 # Then, attach the progress bar to the GtkAlignment
 # widget for later access.
 button = Gtk::Button.new("Click me!")
 hbox = Gtk::HBox.new(false, 5)
 hbox.pack_start(progress, false, false, 5)
 hbox.pack_start(button,   false, false, 5)

You would get the following error if you run this last snippet:

 assig-progBarExperiment.rb: line 3
   Gtk-WARNING **:Attempting to add a widget with type GtkProgressBar to a 
   container of type GtkAlignment, but the widget is already inside a 
   container of type GtkHBox, the GTK+ FAQ at http://www.gtk.org/faq/ 
   explains how to reparent a widget.
