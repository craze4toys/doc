 # Currently you can not change font on arbitrary
 # widgets, likr the button here. But it does work
 # with Gtk::Label widgets.
 #
 # I wished to show the disadvantage of using Gtk::Fixed, 
 # with the original example from Krause's GTK+ book,
 # using buttons, however, as explained above in order to
 # demonstrate that disadvantage I had to bypass the font
 # problem with buttons by changing the top button to Label.
 # Hence if you change the buttons to Labels or to some other
 # editable widget the font experiment will work!
 #
 # label1 = Gtk::Label.new("Pixel by pixel ...")
 # label2 = Gtk::Label.new("you choose my fate")

 button1 = Gtk::Button.new("Pixel by pixel ...")
 button2 = Gtk::Button.new("you choose my fate")

 button1.signal_connect('destroy') { Gtk.main_quit }
 button2.signal_connect('destroy') { Gtk.main_quit }

 fixed.put(button1, 0, 0)
 fixed.put(button2, 20, 30)

 window.add(fixed)
 window.show_all

== The disadvantage of using Fixed Containers

=== First part of the experiment:

If you read the "big" comment in the first example above which implements two buttons, you would know there are currently some problems in Ruby Gtk+ working with fonts on widgets other than editable widgets. This is the reason I have changed the above program to include entry fields rather than buttons. The point I want to bring across is the problem with Gtk::Fixed, when you do not pay attention to detail such as font size. Here is the first part of the experiment using the program with normal fonts:

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 require 'gtk2'

 window = Gtk::Window.new
 window.border_width = 10
 window.title = "Fixed"

 window.signal_connect('delete_event') { false }
 window.signal_connect('destroy') { Gtk.main_quit }

 fixed = Gtk::Fixed.new
 field1 = Gtk::Entry.new
 field2 = Gtk::Entry.new

 fixed.put(field1, 0, 0)
 fixed.put(field2, 20, 30)

 window.add(fixed)
 window.show_all
 Gtk.main

=== Second part of the experiment:

{{image_right("contwidg-fixedcont-02.png")}}
{{br}}

And the following is the second part of the experiment using different (conflicting) font sizes. Of course you should compare the two figures associated with each listing.

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 require 'gtk2'

 window = Gtk::Window.new
 window.border_width = 10
 window.title = "Fixed"

 window.signal_connect('delete_event') { false }
 window.signal_connect('destroy') { Gtk.main_quit }

 fixed = Gtk::Fixed.new
 field1 = Gtk::Entry.new
 field2 = Gtk::Entry.new

 font_desc = Pango::FontDescription.new("Sans 30")
 field1.modify_font(font_desc)

 fixed.put(field1, 0, 0)
 fixed.put(field2, 20, 30)

 window.add(fixed)
 window.show_all
 Gtk.main
