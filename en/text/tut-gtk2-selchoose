== Short Description


All these widgets are members of the so called family of Selectors widgets. In the Gtk documentation you will find them under the heading Selectors (File/Font/Color/Input Devices). The family is divided into four groups:

== Gtk Color Group
* Gtk::ColorButton - A button to launch a color selection dialog
* Gtk::ColorSelection - A widget used to select a color
* Gtk::ColorSelectionDialog - A standard dialog box for selecting a color

== Gtk Font Group
* Gtk::FontButton - A button to launch a font selection dialog
* Gtk::FontSelection - A widget for selecting fonts
* Gtk::FontSelectionDialog - A dialog box for selecting fonts

== Gtk File Group
=== Gtk::FileChooser 

Gtk::FileChooser module represents just an interface, hence we never create any FileChooser instances. The following list describes all FileChooser related classes:

* Gtk::FileChooser - File chooser interface used by  Gtk::FileChooserWidget and Gtk::FileChooserDialog
* Gtk::FileChooserButton - A button to launch a file selection dialog
* Gtk::FileChooserDialog - A file chooser dialogue, suitable for "File/Open" or "File/Save" commands
* Gtk::FileChooserWidget - File chooser widget that can be embedded in other widgets
* Gtk::FileFilter - A filter for selecting a file subset
* Gtk::FileSelection - Prompt the user for a file or directory name (obsolete use Gtk::FileChooserDialog instead)

To give you an idea how some of these fit together we should look at an example you can copy-and-paste into a file on your system, run it and explore the features in the code.

== Gtk::InputDialog - Configure devices for the XInput extension
