= Creating Bins
{{link("tut-gst-link-elements-intro", nil, "tut-gst", "tut-gst-bins-add")}}

Bins are created in the same way that other elements are created. ie. using an element factory, or any of the associated convenience methods:

  # create a new bin called 'mybin'. this bin will be only for organizational purposes; a normal
  # Gst::Bin doesn't affect plan generation
  bin = Gst::ElementFactory.make("bin", "mybin")

  # create a new pipeline
  pipeline = Gst::ElementFactory.make("pipeline", "mypipe")

  # create a new thread, and give it a unique name
  thread = Gst::ElementFactory.make("thread")

  # the core bins (Gst::Bin, Gst::Thread, Gst::Pipeline) also have convenience APIs,
  # Gst::<bintype>.new. These are equivalent to the Gst::ElementFactory.make syntax.
  bin2 = Gst::Bin.new("mybin")
  pipeline2 = Gst::Pipeline.new("mypipe")
  thread2 = Gst::Thread.new
