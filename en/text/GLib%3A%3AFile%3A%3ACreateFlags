== Constants

--- NONE

     No flags set

--- PRIVATE

     Create a file that can only be accessed by the current user

--- REPLACE_DESTINATION

     Replace the destination as if it didn’t exist before. Don’t try to keep
     any old permissions, replace instead of following links. This is generally
     useful if you’re doing a “copy over” rather than a “save new version of”
     replace operation. You can think of it as “unlink destination” before
     writing to it, although the implementation may not be exactly like that.

     Since 2.20
