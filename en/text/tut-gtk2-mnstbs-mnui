== Menu Items

Thus far we learnt about flat menus that displayed labels and (if all worked well in this Ruby/GNOME2 release) separator items. It is also possible to add a submenu to an existing menu item. GTK+ also provides a number of other Gtk::MenuItem objects, such as images, check and radio button menu items.
