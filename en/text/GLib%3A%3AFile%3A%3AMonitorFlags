--- none?

     Checks whether or not any flags have been set

     * Returns: true if no flags have been set

--- send_moved?

     Checks whether GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and
     GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_CREATED events caused by file renames (moves) are
     paired.

     * Returns: true if GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and

       are paired

== Constants

--- NONE

     No flags set

--- SEND_MOVED

     Pair GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_CREATED
     events caused by file renames (moves) and send a single
     GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_MOVED event instead. (Nota bene: not supported on
     all backends; the default behaviour – without specifying this flag – is to
     send single GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and
     GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_CREATED events.)

--- WATCH_MOUNTS

     Watch for mount events
