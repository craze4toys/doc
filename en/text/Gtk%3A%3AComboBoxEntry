= class Gtk::ComboBoxEntry
((<URL:http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/combo-box-entry.png>))

A Gtk::ComboBoxEntry is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of valid choices or enter a different value. It is very similar to a Gtk::ComboBox, but it displays the selected value in an entry to allow modifying it. 

In contrast to a Gtk::ComboBox, the underlying model of a Gtk::ComboBoxEntry must always have a text column (see Gtk::ComboBoxEntry#text_column=), and the entry will show the content of the text column in the selected row. To get the text from the entry, use Gtk::ComboBox#active_text.

== Class Methods
--- Gtk::ComboBoxEntry.new(is_text_only = true)
    Creates a new Gtk::ComboBoxEntry which has a Gtk::Entry as child. If is_text_only is true, you should only manipulate its data source with the following convenience methods: Gtk::ComboBox#append_text, Gtk::ComboBox#insert_text, Gtk::ComboBox#prepend_text? and Gtk::ComboBox#remove_text. If is_text_only is false, you should set a model using Gtk::ComboBox#model= and a text_column using Gtk::ComboBoxEntry#text_column= after construction.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * Returns: A new Gtk::ComboBoxEntry.  

--- Gtk::ComboBoxEntry.new(model, text_column)
    Creates a new Gtk::ComboBoxEntry which has a Gtk::Entry as child and a list of strings as popup. You can get the Gtk::Entry from a Gtk::ComboBoxEntry using Gtk::Bin#child. To add and remove strings from the list, just modify model using its data manipulation API.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * text_column: A column in model to get the strings from.  
    * Returns: A new Gtk::ComboBoxEntry.  

== Instance Methods

--- text_column
    Returns the column which entry_box is using to get the strings from.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * Returns: A column in the data source model
--- text_column=(text_column)
    Sets the model column which entry_box should use to get strings from.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * text_column: A column in model to get the strings from.
    * Returns: text_column
--- set_text_column(text_column)
    Same as Gtk::ComboBoxEntry#text_column=.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * text_column: A column in model to get the strings from.
    * Returns: self

== Properties
--- text-column: Integer (Read/Write)
    A column in the data source model to get the strings from.  ((* Since 2.4 *))
    * Allowed values: >= -1
    * Default value: -1
