= class GLib::ThemedIcon

GLib::ThemedIcon is an implementation of GLib::Icon that supports icon themes.
GLib::ThemedIcon contains a list of all of the icons present in an icon theme,
so that icons can be looked up quickly. GLib::ThemedIcon does not provide
actual pixmaps for icons, just the icon names. Ideally something like
Gtk::IconTheme#choose_icon should be used to resolve the list of names so that
fallback icons work nicely with themes that inherit other themes.
