= Simple Text Editor
Simple UTF-8 Text Editor.
This is a sample application for Ruby/GNOME2, Ruby/Libglade2.

== Download
* {{attach_anchor("simple-editor.rb")}}
* {{attach_anchor("simple-editor.glade")}}

Save simple-editor.[rb|glade] to same directory. If you use the Opera browser, simple-editor.glade will accidentally be saved as simple-editor.xml. So you have to rename it.


== Requirements
Developed environments are:
* ruby 1.9.0 (2004-02-14) [i686-linux]
* Ruby-GNOME2-0.9.0(Ruby/GTK2, Ruby/GNOME2, Ruby/Libglade2)
