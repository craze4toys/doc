== Fedora Core 5

=== Installation

There are RPM packages for Fedora Core 5 available. You can download them ((<here|URL:
http://franz.hob-bruneck.info/downloads/fc5/ruby-gnome2/0.14.1/ruby-gnome2-0.14.1-fc5.tar.gz>)). Simply untar the package and install the RPMs.

The binding for GDA (GNOME Data Access) is missing, Ruby/Libgda seems not to be compatible yet with the version of libgda delivered with Fedora Core 5.

Make sure that the package gtkglext (e.g. ((<here|URL:http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/extras/5/i386/>))) is installed, it is not on the CDs/DVD.

The packages are available for the i386 architecture.

Martin Kaffanke kindly set up a ((<yum-repository|URL:http://kleinerdrache.org/repos/fc5/repodata/>)) with the Ruby-GNOME2-Packages included. After having installed the configuration as described on the ((<here|URL:http://kleinerdrache.org/>)), you should be able to install all packages with the following command: yum install ruby-gnome2

Have fun with Ruby-GNOME2!
