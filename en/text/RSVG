== Module Functions

--- RSVG.pixbuf_from_file(file_name)

     Loads a new Gdk::Pixbuf from (({file_name})) and
     returns it. If an error occurred, raises an exception.
     
     * file_name: A file name
     * Returns: A newly allocated Gdk::Pixbuf, or raises an
       exception.

--- RSVG.pixbuf_from_file_at_max_size(file_name, max_width, max_height)

     Loads a new Gdk::Pixbuf from (({file_name})) and
     returns it. This pixbuf is uniformly scaled so that the
     it fits into a rectangle of size (({max_width})) *
     (({max_height})). If an error occurred, raises an exception.

     * file_name: A file name
     * max_width: The requested max width
     * max_height: The requested max height
     * Returns: A newly allocated Gdk::Pixbuf, or raises an
       exception.

--- RSVG.pixbuf_from_file_at_size(file_name, width, height)

     Loads a new Gdk::Pixbuf from (({file_name})) and
     returns it. This pixbuf is scaled from the size
     indicated to the new size indicated by (({width})) and
     (({height})). If either of these are -1, then the
     default size of the image being loaded is used. If an
     error occurred, raises an exception.

     * file_name: A file name
     * width: The new width, or -1
     * height: The new height, or -1
     * Returns: A newly allocated Gdk::Pixbuf, or raises an
       exception.

--- RSVG.pixbuf_from_file_at_zoom(file_name, x_zoom, y_zoom)

     Loads a new Gdk::Pixbuf from (({file_name})) and
     returns it. This pixbuf is scaled from the size
     indicated by the file by a factor of (({x_zoom})) and
     (({y_zoom})). If an error occurred, raises an exception.

     * file_name: A file name
     * x_zoom: The horizontal zoom factor
     * y_zoom: The vertical zoom factor
     * Returns: A newly allocated Gdk::Pixbuf, or raises an
       exception.

--- RSVG.pixbuf_from_file_at_zoom_with_max(file_name, x_zoom, y_zoom, max_width, max_height)

     Loads a new Gdk::Pixbuf from (({file_name})) and
     returns it. This pixbuf is scaled from the size
     indicated by the file by a factor of (({x_zoom})) and
     (({y_zoom})). If the resulting pixbuf would be larger
     than (({max_width}))/(({max_height})) it is uniformly
     scaled down to fit in that rectangle. If an error
     occurred, raises an exception.

     * file_name: A file name
     * x_zoom: The horizontal zoom factor
     * y_zoom: The vertical zoom factor
     * max_width: The requested max width
     * max_height: The requested max height
     * Returns: A newly allocated Gdk::Pixbuf, or raises an
       exception.

--- RSVG.set_default_dpi(dpi)

    Sets the DPI for the all future outgoing pixbufs. Common values are 75, 90, and 300 DPI. Passing a number <= 0 to dpi will reset the DPI to whatever the default value happens to be.

    * dpi: Dots Per Inch (aka Pixels Per Inch)

--- RSVG.set_default_dpi_x_y(dpi_x, dpi_y)

     
     Sets the DPI for the outgoing pixbuf. Common values are
     75, 90, and 300 DPI. Passing a number <= 0 to (({dpi_x})) or
     (({dpi_y})) will reset the DPI to whatever the default value
     happens to be.

     * dpi_x: Dots Per Inch (aka Pixels Per Inch) of x
     * dpi_y: Dots Per Inch (aka Pixels Per Inch) of y
     * Returns: (({nil}))

--- RSVG.cairo_available?

     * Returns: self: ((*FIXME*))
