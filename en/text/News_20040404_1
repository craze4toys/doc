== Yet another Ruby-GNOME2 Website
((*Posted by Masao on 2004-04-04 (Sun) 14:08:32*))

Now, we've started a new project website in Portuguese from Brazil(pt_BR) by Joao Pedrosa. 

http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/pt_BR/

Are there other translaters for this(or other) sites? If you can help us, ask me the account of our website.

We always need your helps.
