= class GLib::BufferedOutputStream

Buffered output stream implements GLib::FilterOutputStream and provides for
buffered writes.

By default, GLib::BufferedOutputStream's buffer size is set at 4 kilobytes.

To create a buffered output stream, use GLib::BufferedOutputStream.new.

To get the size of a buffer within a buffered input stream, use
GLib::BufferedOutputStream#buffer_size. To change the size of a buffered output
stream’s buffer, use GLib::BufferedOutputStream#buffer_size=. Note that the
buffer’s size cannot be reduced below the size of the data within the buffer.

== Class Methods

--- GLib::BufferedOutputStream.new(base_stream, size = 4096)

     Creates a new GLib::BufferedOutputStream for ((|base_stream|)), with a
     buffer size set to ((|size|)).

     * base_stream: A GLib::InputStream
     * Returns: A new GLib::BufferedOutputStream

== Instance Methods

--- auto_grow=(auto_grow)

     Same as GLib::BufferedOutputStream#set_auto_grow.

     * Returns: ((|auto_grow|))

--- auto_grow?

     Checks if the buffer automatically grows as data is added.

     * Returns: true if this stream’s buffer automatically grows

--- buffer_size

     Gets the size of the input buffer.

     * Returns: The size of the input buffer

--- buffer_size=(buffer_size)

     Same as GLib::BufferedInputStream#set_buffer_size.

     * Returns: buffer_size

--- set_auto_grow(auto_grow)

     Sets whether or not the buffer should automatically grow or not.

     * auto_grow: true if the buffer should automatically grow
     * Returns: self

--- set_buffer_size(buffer_size)

     Sets the size of the input buffer.

     * buffer_size: The size of the input buffer
     * Returns: self

== Properties

--- auto-grow: true or false (Read/Write)

     Whether or not the buffer should automatically grow

     Default value: false

--- buffer-size: Integer (Read/Write)

     The size of the input buffer

     Allowed values: ≥ 1

     Default value: 4096
