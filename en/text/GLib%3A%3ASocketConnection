= class GLib::SocketConnection

GLib::SocketConnection is a GLib::IOStream for a connected socket. They can be created
either by GLib::SocketClient when connecting to a host, or by GLib::SocketListener when
accepting a new client.

The type of the GLib::SocketConnection object returned from these calls depends on
the type of the underlying socket that is in use. For instance, for a TCP/IP
connection it will be a GLib::TcpConnection.
