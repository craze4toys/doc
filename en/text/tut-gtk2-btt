== Short Description

In Gtk+ we can find many widgets that contain the word "Button" in their name, but the primary button widgets are just a few. Following is the list of those, and in Gtk documentation you will also find them under the same heading as this article (Buttons and Toggles):

    * Gtk::Button - A widget that creates a signal when clicked on
    * Gtk::CheckButton - Create widgets with a discrete toggle button
    * Gtk::RadioButton - A choice from multiple check buttons
    * Gtk::ToggleButton - Create buttons which retain their state
    * Gtk::LinkButton - Create buttons bound to a URL

It may be beneficial to look at the button hierarchy:

 GtkButton
 |   GtkToggleButton
 |   |   GtkCheckButton
 |   |   |   GtkRadioButton
 |   GtkColorButton
 |   GtkFontButton
 |   GtkLinkButton
 |   GtkOptionMenu
 |   GtkScaleButton
 |   |   GtkVolumeButton


Some (most) of the above items will be explained in the following sections.
