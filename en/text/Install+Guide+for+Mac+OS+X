port makes installation very simple, just do

sudo port install rb-gnome

If you don't have port, you can get macport here: http://www.macports.org/install.php (something to note is that it is going to favor installing everything in /opt/local, and that libxml2 is known to have problems installing automagically with +zlib, which is required for glade-3)
