== Gtk::FileChooser 

Gtk::FileChooser module represents just an interface, hence we never create any FileChooser instances. The following list describes all FileChooser related classes:

* Gtk::FileChooser - File chooser interface used by  Gtk::FileChooserWidget and Gtk::FileChooserDialog
* Gtk::FileChooserButton - A button to launch a file selection dialog
* Gtk::FileChooserDialog - A file chooser dialogue, suitable for "File/Open" or "File/Save" commands
* Gtk::FileChooserWidget - File chooser widget that can be embedded in other widgets
* Gtk::FileFilter - A filter for selecting a file subset
* Gtk::FileSelection - Prompt the user for a file or directory name (obsolete use Gtk::FileChooserDialog instead)

To give you an idea how some of these fit together we should look at an example you can copy-and-paste into a file on your system, run it and explore the features in the code.
