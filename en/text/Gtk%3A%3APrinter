= class Gtk::Printer

A Gtk::Printer object represents a printer. You only need to deal directly with printers if you use the non-portable Gtk::PrintUnixDialog API.

A Gtk::Printer allows to get status information about the printer, such as its description, its location, the number of queued jobs, etc. Most importantly, a Gtk::Printer object can be used to create a Gtk::PrintJob object, which lets you print to the printer.

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

== Class Methods

--- Gtk::Printer.each(wait = false){|printer| ... }

     Iterates all ((<Gtk::Printer>))s.  ((* Since 2.10 *))
     * {|printer| ...}: a block to iterate printers.
       * printer: an Gtk::Printer
       * Returns: true if the enumeration is stopped, false is continue.
     * wait: if true, wait in a recursive mainloop until all
       printers are enumerated; otherwise return early
     * Returns: self

--- Gtk::Printer.printers(wait = false)

    Retrives Printers. ((* Since 2.10 *))
     * wait: if true, wait in a recursive mainloop until all
       printers are enumerated; otherwise return early
    * Returns: An Array of ((<Gtk::Printer>))s.

--- Gtk::Printer.new(name, backend, virtual)

     Creates a new Gtk::Printer. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * name: the name of the printer
     * backend: a Gtk::PrintBackend
     * virtual: whether the printer is virtual
     * Returns: a new Gtk::Printer

== Instance Methods

--- <=>(other)

     Compares two printers. ((* Since 2.10 *))
