= class GLib::FileMonitor

Monitors a file or directory for changes.

To obtain a GLib::FileMonitor for a file or directory, use GLib::File#monitor,
GLib::File#monitor_file, or GLib::File#monitor_directory.

To get informed about changes to the file or directory you are monitoring,
connect to the “changed” signal. The signal will be emitted in the
thread-default main context of the thread that the monitor was created in
(though if the global default main context is blocked, this may cause
notifications to be blocked even if the thread-default context is still
running).

== Instance Methods

--- cancel

     Cancels a file monitor.

     * Returns: true if monitor was cancelled

--- cancelled?

     Returns whether or not the monitor has been cancelled.

     * Returns: true if the monitor has been cancelled

--- rate_limit

     Gets the limit of the monitor to watch for changes, in milliseconds.

     * Returns: The limit of the monitor to watch for changes, in milliseconds

--- rate_limit=(rate_limit)

     Same as GLib::FileMonitor#set_rate_limit.

     * Returns: ((|rate_limit|))

--- set_rate_limit(rate_limit)

    Sets the limit of the monitor to watch for changes, in milliseconds.

     * rate_limit: The limit of the monitor to watch for changes, in milliseconds
     * Returns: self

== Constants

--- EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_CHANGED

     A file’s attributes has changed.

--- EVENT_CHANGED

     A file has changed.

--- EVENT_CHANGES_DONE_HINT

     A hint that this was probably the last change in a set of changes.

--- EVENT_CREATED

     A file was created.

--- EVENT_DELETED

     A file was deleted.

--- EVENT_MOVED

     A file wast moved.

--- EVENT_PRE_UNMOUNT

     A file location will soon be unmounted.

--- EVENT_UNMOUNTED

     A file location was unmounted.

--- NONE

     No flags set

--- SEND_MOVED

     Pair GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_CREATED
     events caused by file renames (moves) and send a single
     GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_MOVED event instead. (Nota bene: not supported on
     all backends; the default behaviour – without specifying this flag – is to
     send single GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_DELETED and
     GLib::FileMonitor::EVENT_CREATED events.)

--- WATCH_MOUNTS

     Watch for mount events

== Properties

--- cancelled: true or false (Read)

     Whether or not the monitor has been cancelled.

--- rate-limit: Integer (Read/Write)

     The limit of the monitor to watch for changes, in milliseconds.

== Signals

--- changed: self, file, other_file, event_type

     This signal is emitted when a file has been changed.

     * self: The GLib::FileMonitor emitting the event
     * file: A GLib::File
     * other_file: A GLib::File
     * event_type: A Glib::FileMonitor::Event
