= class GLib::InetAddress

GLib::InetAddress represents an IPv4 or IPv6 internet address. Use
GLib::Resolver#lookup_by_name or GLib::Resolver#lookup_by_name_async to look up
the GLib::InetAddress for a hostname. Use GLib::Resolver#lookup_by_address or
GLib::Resolver#lookup_by_address_async to look up the hostname for a
GLib::InetAddress.

To actually connect to a remote host, you will need a GLib::InetSocketAddress
(which includes a GLib::InetAddress as well as a port number).

== Class Methods

--- GLib::InetAddress.new_any(family)

    Creates a GLib::InetAddress for the “any” address (unassigned/“don’t care”)
    for ((|family|)). 

     * family: The GLib::Socket::Family
     * Returns: A new GLib::InetAddress corresponding to the “any” address of
       ((|family|))

--- GLib::InetAddress.new_from_bytes(bytes, family)

     Creates a new GLib::InetAddress from the given family and bytes. bytes
     should be 4 bytes for GLib::Socket::FAMILY_IPV4 and 16 bytes for
     GLib::Socket::FAMILY_IPV6.

     * bytes: Raw address data
     * family: The GLib::Socket::Family
     * Returns: A new GLib::InetAddress corresponding to ((|family|)) and
       ((|bytes|))

--- GLib::InetAddress.new_from_string(string)

     Parses ((|string|)) as an IP address and creates a new GLib::InetAddress.

     * string: A String representation of an IP address
     * Returns: a new GLib::InetAddress corresponding to ((|string|)), or nil
       if ((|string|)) couldn’t be parsed

--- GLib::InetAddress.new_loopback(family)

     Creates a GLib::InetAddress for the loopback address for ((|family|))

     * Returns: a new GLib::InetAddress corresponding to the loopback address
     * for ((|family|))

== Instance Methods

--- any?

     Checks whether or not this is the “any” address for its family.

     * Returns: true if this is the “any” address for its family

--- bytes

     Gets the raw address data.

     * Returns: The raw address data

--- family

     Gets the address family (IPv4 or IPv6).

     * Returns: The GLib::Socket::Family

--- get_native_size

     Gets the size of the native raw binary address for this address. This
     is the size of the data that you get from GLib::InetAddress#to_bytes.

     Since 2.22

     * Returns: The number of bytes used for the native version of this address

--- link_local?

     Checks whether or not this is a link-local address.

     * Returns: true if this is a link-local address

--- loopback?

     Checks whether or not this is the loopback address for its family.

     * Returns: true if this is the loopback address for its family

--- mc_global?

     Checks whether or not this is a global multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is a global multicast address

--- mc_link_local?

     Checks whether or not this is a link-local multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is a link-local multicast address

--- mc_node_local?

    Checks whether or not this is a node-local multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is a node-local multicast address

--- mc_org_local?

    Checks whether or not this is an organization-local multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is an organization-local multicast address

--- mc_site_local?

    Checks whether or not this is a site-local multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is a site-local multicast address

--- multicast?

    Checks whether or not this is a multicast address.

     * Returns: true if this is a multicast address

--- site_local?

    Checks whether or not this is a site-local address.

     * Returns: true if this is a site-local address

--- to_bytes

     Gets the raw binary address data from this address.

     Since 2.22

     * Returns: A String containing the bytes in this address

--- to_s

     Same as GLib::InetAddress#to_string.

--- to_str

     Same as GLib::InetAddress#to_string.

--- to_string

     Converts this address to String form.

     Since 2.22

     * Returns: A representation of this address as a String
