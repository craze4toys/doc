= class Gtk::PrintUnixDialog

Gtk::PrintUnixDialog implements a print dialog for platforms
which don't provide a native print dialog, like Unix. It can
be used very much like any other GTK+ dialog, at the cost of
the portability offered by ((<Gtk::PrintOperation>))

In order to print something with Gtk::PrintUnixDialog, you
need to use Gtk::PrintUnixDialog#selected_printer to
obtain a Gtk::Printer object and use it to construct a
Gtk::PrintJob using Gtk::PrintJob.new.

Gtk:PrintUnixDialog uses the following response values:
* Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_OK: for the "Print" button
* Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_APPLY: for the "Preview" button
* Gtk::Dialog::RESPONSE_CANCEL: for the "Cancel" button

== Class Methods

--- Gtk::PrintUnixDialog.new(title=nil, parent=nil)

     Creates a new Gtk::PrintUnixDialog. ((* Since 2.10 *))

     * title: Title of the dialog, or nil
     * parent: Transient parent of the dialog, or nil
     * Returns: a new Gtk::PrintUnixDialog

== Instance Methods

--- add_custom_tab(child, tab_label)

     Adds a custom tab to the print dialog.((* Since 2.10 *))

--- manual_capability=(capabilities)

     This lets you specify the printing capabilities your
     application supports. For instance, if you can handle
     scaling the output then you pass
     Gtk::PrintUnixDialog::CAPABILITY_SCALE. If you don't pass that,
     then the dialog will only let you select the scale if
     the printing system automatically handles scaling.((* Since 2.10 *))
