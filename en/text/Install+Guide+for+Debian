== Debian GNU/Linux

=== Installing

Currently, official packages exist only for the testing and unstable distributions of
Debian. Each binding is available as a separate package. For example,the GTK+
binding is available as libgtk2-ruby. You can install all the packages by
installing the ruby-gnome2 package, which depends on all the others. Running
"apt-get install ruby-gnome2" as root should do the trick.

Make sure you read the README.Debian file, which is available in
/usr/share/doc/<package>.

There is also ((<Dafydd's personal APT repository|URL:http://muse.19inch.net/~daf/debian/>)).

Packages in Debian testing may be older than those in unstable, which may in turn be older than those in Dafydd's personal APT repository.

RBBR is not currently an official package, but will hopefully be uploaded
soon. In the meantime, it is available from Dafydd's repository.

=== Bugs in Packages

Bugs in the packages should be filed as normal in the ((<Debian Bug Tracking
System|URL:http://bugs.debian.org>)). Questions about the packages should be
directed to the maintainer, Dafydd Harries <daf@muse.19inch.net>.
