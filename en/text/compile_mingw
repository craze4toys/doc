= Compile Guide for MS Windows (mswin32, mingw32)
This is a guide on how to compile and install ruby-1.8.1 and ruby-gtk2-0.16.0 on Microsoft Windows.
You can use the *.[so|rb] files which you will get following this article as a library for ((<Ruby Installer For Windows|URL:http://rubyinstaller.sourceforge.net/>)).

== Install MinGW and MSYS
First, install MinGW and MSYS. This guide is based on the default configurations.

((<URL:http://www.mingw.org/>))
* MinGW-5.1.2.exe (using the default installation options) 
   * Installed to c:\MinGW

* MSYS-1.0.10.exe (using the default installation options)
   * Installed to c:\msys\1.0

If you try cvs version of Ruby-GNOME2, you also need to install msysDTK-1.0.1.exe.

Just follow the default settings upon questions during the installation.
At once, while installing MSYS, you will need to input where MinGW is installed (which should be c:/MinGW). 
Notice that you need to install them in this specific order (MinGW at first, MSYS after).

== Install GTK+ Libraries from ((<GLADE for Windows|URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/gladewin32/>)).
Download the latest gtk-dev package from ((<GLADE for Windows|URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98754>)).

* gtk-dev-2.10.11-win32-1.exe
   * Installed to c:\GTK

== Compile/Install Ruby
Download ruby-1.8.5-p12.tar.gz from ((<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/>)).
Put it in c:\msys\1.0\home\(username)\.

Then, from the MSYS console (you can find it from the desktop icon or via the start menu), do as below:

 $ tar xvzf ruby-1.8.5-p12.tar.gz
 $ cd ruby-1.8.5
 $ configure --prefix=/MinGW
 $ make
 $ make install

ruby-1.8.5 is installed on c:\MinGW\[bin|lib|share|].

== Compile/Install ruby-gnome2-0.16.0
=== Compiling Ruby/GLib2
At first, you need to compile Ruby/GLib first.

 $ tar xvzf ruby-gnome2-0.16.0.tar.gz
 $ cd ruby-gnome2-0.16.0
 $ export PATH=/c/GTK/bin:$PATH
 $ cd glib
 $ unset RUBYOPT
 $ /c/MinGW/bin/ruby.exe extconf.rb --ruby=/c/MinGW/bin/ruby.exe
 $ make
 $ make install

=== Compiling/Installing rcairo
rcairo is required by other Ruby-GNOME2 libraries such as Ruby/GTK2.

You need to compile/install rcairo before compiling other Ruby-GNOME2
libraries.

Download rcairo from http://cairographics.org/releases/ and put it in c:\msys\1.0\home\(username)\. 

 $ tar xvaf rcairo-1.2.0.tar.gz
 $ cd rcairo-1.2.0
 $ /c/MinGW/bin/ruby.exe setup.rb

=== Compiling other Ruby-GNOME2 libraries
Then you can compile other Ruby-GNOME2 libraries. Note to set CAIRO_PATH correctly.

 $ cd ../ruby-gnome2-0.16.0
 $ export CAIRO_PATH=/c/msys/1.0/home/(username)/rcairo
 $ /c/MinGW/bin/ruby.exe extconf.rb --ruby=/c/MinGW/bin/ruby.exe
 $ make
 $ make install

Some sub-libraries won't succeed to install because these libraries aren't installed from gladewin32. But don't mind.
All target files are installed on c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\*.rb and c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\i386-msvcrt\*.[so|h].

== How to use them with ((<Ruby Installer For Windows|URL:http://rubyinstaller.sourceforge.net/>))
Copy c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\*.rb and c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\i386-msvcrt\*.so to the directory where you installed the Ruby Installer.
(e.g.) If you installed it to c:\ruby, then copy c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\*.rb to c:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\, and copy c:\MinGW\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\i386-msvcrt\*.so to c:\ruby\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\
