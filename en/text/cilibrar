My name is Rudi Cilibrasi and my username is cilibrar.  I really enjoy Ruby because it
puts the fun back in programming.  I maintain ((<MPIRuby|URL:http://mpiruby.sourceforge.net>)), 
((<RubySVM|URL:http://rubysvm.sourceforge.net>)), and ((<CompLearn|URL:http://complearn.sourceforge.net>)) (also ruby) on ((<SourceForge|URL:http://www.sourceforge.net>)).
MPIRuby is used to do supercomputer parallel programming in MPI in Ruby.  RubySVM is a machine
learning algorithm for all sorts of pattern recognition using Support Vector Machines.  CompLearn
is a compression-based machine learning toolkit that supports Quartet Tree Reconstruction and SVM.

I also love playing Warcraft III and you can see me on Battle.net as Planar.

Happy programming everybody!!!
