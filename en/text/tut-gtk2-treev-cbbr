== Combo Box Renderers


By this time I'd be pleasantly surprised if Combo Box Renderer would be working. 



{{image_right("dialog-warning.png")}}
Due to the problems with the past few renderer examples, I first implemented the combo box cell renderer functionality into C version of ((*treestore.c*)). Indeed, it did not work. However it behaved better without the error/warning messages as all earlier offenders did. You can check tis C GTK+ version of combo box renderer example by clicking on:  ((<treestore-combob.c|tut-gtk2-treev-treev-combob-cgtk-01>))

== Progress Bar Renderers

{{image_right("dialog-warning.png")}}
In the future there will perhaps also be a Gtk::CellRendererProgress example, however, at this point I will skip investigating this topic. I Invite you to update this article as soon as there will be some news from the developers about these issues.
