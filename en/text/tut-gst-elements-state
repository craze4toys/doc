{{link("tut-gst-bins-ghost-pads", nil, "tut-gst", "tut-gst-helloworld")}}

Here are the most important states of a Gst::Element:

:Gst::Element::STATE_NULL	
 Reset the state of an element.
:Gst::Element::STATE_READY	
 Will make the element ready to start processing data.
:Gst::Element::STATE_PAUSED	
 Temporary stops the data flow.
:Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING	
 Means there really is data flowing through the graph.

The state of an element can be changed and retrieved with the following code:

 # Start playback
 bin.state = Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING

 ...

 # Playing?
 if bin.state == Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING
    # do some stuff here
  end
 
== Shortcuts

For your convenience, the following shortcuts are available:

 bin.ready      # same as bin.state = Gst::Element::STATE_READY
 bin.play       # same as bin.state = Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING
 bin.pause      # same as bin.state = Gst::Element::STATE_PAUSED
 bin.stop       # same as bin.state = Gst::Element::STATE_NULL

 bin.ready?     # checks if bin.state == Gst::Element::STATE_READY
 bin.playing?   # checks if bin.state == Gst::Element::STATE_PLAYING
 bin.paused?    # checks if bin.state == Gst::Element::STATE_PAUSED
 bin.stopped?   # checks if bin.state == Gst::Element::STATE_NULL
