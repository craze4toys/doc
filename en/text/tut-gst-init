= Initializing
{{link("tut-gst-intro", nil, "tut-gst", "tut-gst-elements-intro")}}

When writing a Ruby/GStreamer application, you can simply require "gst" to get access to the library classes and methods.

Before the Ruby/GStreamer library can be used Gst.init has to be called from the main application. This call will perform the necessary initialization of the library as well as parse the GStreamer-specific command line options.

A typical program would start like this:
  
  require 'gst'

  Gst.init
  # ...

Use the Gst::VERSION_MAJOR, Gst::VERSION_MINOR and Gst::VERSION_MICRO macros to get the GStreamer version you are using.  You can also get them via the Gst.version function.
