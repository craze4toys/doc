= class Gtk::Calendar
Gtk::Calendar is a widget that displays a calendar, one month at a time. It can be created with Gtk::Calendar.new. 

The month and year currently displayed can be altered with Gtk::Calendar#select_month. The exact day can be selected from the displayed month using Gtk::Calendar#select_day. 

To place a visual marker on a particular day, use Gtk::Calendar#mark_day and to remove the marker, Gtk::Calendar#unmark_day. Alternative, all marks can be cleared with Gtk::Calendar#clear_marks. 

The way in which the calendar itself is displayed can be altered using Gtk::Calendar#display_options. 

The selected date can be retrieved from a Gtk::Calendar using Gtk::Calendar#date. 

If performing many 'mark' operations, the calendar can be frozen to prevent flicker, using Gtk::Calendar#freeze, and 'thawed' again using Gtk::Calendar#thaw.
