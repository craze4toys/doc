= class Gtk::SeparatorToolItem
A Gtk::SeparatorItem is a Gtk::ToolItem that separates groups of other ((<Gtk::ToolItem>))s. Depending on the theme, a Gtk::SeparatorToolItem will often look like a vertical line on horizontally docked toolbars. 

If the property "expand" is true and the property "draw" is false, a Gtk::SeparatorToolItem will act as a "spring" that forces other items to the ends of the toolbar.
