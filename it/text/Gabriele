==Gabriele
I'm an hobbyist ruby programmer.
I just started trying ruby-gnome2 and it is so much impressive that I felt
I should help somehow :-)

So, I started helping ((<metnik>)) to translate this wiki in my home language 
(italian).

Oh, and I'm a proud member of the ((<Ruby User Group Italia|URL:http://ada2.unipv.it/ruby>))

For any hint or note about the translation, write to surrender_it at yahoo dot it
