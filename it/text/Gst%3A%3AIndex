= class Gst::Index
Generates indexes on objects.

== Object Hierarchy
* Object
  * GLib::Instantiatable
    * GLib::Object
      * Gst::Object
        * Gst::Index

== Class Methods
--- Gst::Index.new
    This method returns a newly allocated Gst::Index object.
    * Returns: a newly allocated Gst::Index object.

== Instance Methods
--- add(id, *args)
    Adds an entry into the index.  The type of the entry depends of
    the number and kind of additional parameters.
    	* For an ID type, args must be a String.
    	* For a FORMAT type, args must be a Gst::Format.
    	* For an ASSOCIATION type, args must contains an association flag (see ((<GstAssocFlags|Gst::Index#GstAssocFlags>))), a Gst::Format and a value for the format.
    	* For an OBJECT type, well you must wait, because it is not yet implemented.
    * args: additional parameters, see below.  
    * id: the ID of the index writer. 
    * Returns: a reference to the newly allocated entry in the index, as a Gst::EntryIndex object.

--- certainty
    This method returns the certainty of the index (see ((<GstIndexCertainty|Gst::Index#GstIndexCertainty>))).
    * Returns: the certainty of the index (see ((<GstIndexCertainty|Gst::Index#GstIndexCertainty>))).

--- certainty=(certainty)
    Sets the certainty of the index.
    * certainty: the certainty to set (see ((<GstIndexCertainty|Gst::Index#GstIndexCertainty>))).  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'certainty'.

--- commit(id)
    Tells the index that the writer with the given ID is done with 
    this index and is not going to write any more entries to it.
    * id: the writer that committed the index.  
    * Returns: self.

--- get_assoc_entry(id, method, flags, format, value) { ... }
    Finds the given format/value in the index.  If a block is given, it will be
    called as a compare function, passing references to 2 Gst::IndexEntry objects,
    and waiting for a boolean as the return value.
    * flags: flags for the entry (see ((<GstAssocFlags|Gst::Index#GstAssocFlags>))). 
    * format: a Gst::Format object. 
    * method: the lookup method to use (see ((<GstIndexLookupMethod|Gst::Index#GstIndexLookupMethod>))). 
    * id: the ID of the index writer. 
    * value: the value to find.  
    * Returns: the entry associated with the value (as a Gst::IndexEntry object), or nil  if the value is not found.

--- group
    This method returns the ID of the current group.
    * Returns: the ID of the current group.

--- group=(group)
    Sets the current group number to the given argument.
    * group: the number of the group to set.  
    * Returns: the given parameter 'group'.

--- new_group
    Creates a new group for the given index.  It will be set as the current
    group.
    * Returns: the ID of the newly created group.

--- readable?
    This method returns whether the index can be read.
    * Returns: whether the index can be read.

--- set_certainty(certainty)
    Sets the certainty of the index.
    * certainty: the certainty to set (see ((<GstIndexCertainty|Gst::Index#GstIndexCertainty>))).  
    * Returns: self.

--- set_group(group)
    Sets the current group number to the given argument.
    * group: the number of the group to set.  
    * Returns: true if the operation succeeded, false if the group did not exist.

--- writable?
    This method returns whether the index can be written.
    * Returns: whether the index can be written.
