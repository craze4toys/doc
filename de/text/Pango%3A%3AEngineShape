= class Pango::EngineShape
The Pango::EngineShape class is implemented by engines that customize the rendering-system dependent part of the Pango pipeline for a particular script or language. A Pango::EngineShape implementation is then specific to both a particular rendering system or group of rendering systems and to a particular script. For instance, there is one Pango::EngineShape implementation to handling shaping Arabic for Fontconfig-based backends.
