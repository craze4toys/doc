= class Gtk::CellRendererSpin

A Gtk::CellRendererSpin renders text in a cell like Gtk::CellRendererText from which it is derived. But while Gtk::CellRendererText offers a simple entry to edit the text, Gtk::CellRendererSpin offers a Gtk::SpinButton widget. Of course, that means that the text has to be parseable as a floating point number.

The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in the tree model, like all properties of cell renders. Gtk::CellRendererSpin also has properties for the climb rate and the number of digits to display. Other Gtk::SpinButton properties can be set in a handler for the "start-editing" signal.
