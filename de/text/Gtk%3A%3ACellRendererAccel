= class Gtk::CellRendererAccel
Gtk::CellRendererAccel displays a keyboard accelerator (i.e. a key combination like <Control>-a). If the cell renderer is editable, the accelerator can be changed by simply typing the new combination.

The Gtk::CellRendererAccel cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.

== Constants
=== Mode
--- MODE_GTK
--- MODE_OTHER

== Properties
--- accel-key: Integer (Read/Write)
    The keyval of the accelerator ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * Allowed values: <= GLib::MAXINT
    * Default value: 0

--- accel-mode: Gtk::CellRendererAccel#Mode (Read/Write)
    The type of accelerators ((* Since 2.10 *))
    Determines if the edited accelerators are GTK+ accelerators. If they are, consumed modifiers are suppressed, only accelerators accepted by GTK+ are allowed, and the accelerators are rendered in the same way as they are in menus.
    * Default value: Gtk::CellRendererAccel::MODE_GTK

--- accel-mods: Gdk::ModifierType (Read/Write)
    The modifier mask of the accelerator (((<GdkModifierType|Gdk::Window#GdkModifierType>))) ((* Since 2.10 *))

--- keycode: Integer (Read/Write)
    The hardware keycode of the accelerator. Note that the hardware keycode is only relevant if the key does not have a keyval. Normally, the keyboard configuration should assign keyvals to all keys. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * Allowed values: <= GLib::MAXINT
    * Default value: 0

== Signals
--- accel-cleared: self, path_string
    Gets emitted when the user has removed the accelerator. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * self: the object reveiving the signal
    * path_string: the path identifying the row of the edited cell

--- accel-edited: self, path_string, accel_key, accel_mods, hardware_key
    Gets emitted when the user has selected a new accelerator. ((* Since 2.10 *))
    * self: the object reveiving the signal
    * path_string: the path identifying the row of the edited cell
    * accel_key: the new accelerator keyval
    * accel_mods: the new acclerator modifier mask (Gdk::ModifierType#ModifierType)
    * hardware_keycode: the keycode of the new accelerator

== ChangeLog
* 2007-02-03: Added for GTK+-2.10. - ((<Masao>))
