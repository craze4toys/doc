= class Gtk::RecentChooserMenu
Gtk::RecentChooserMenu is a widget suitable for displaying recently used files inside a menu. It can be used to set a sub-menu of a Gtk::MenuItem using Gtk::MenuItem#set_submenu, or as the menu of a Gtk::MenuToolButton.

Note that Gtk::RecentChooserMenu does not have any methods of its own. Instead, you should use the methods that work on a Gtk::RecentChooser.

Note also that Gtk::RecentChooserMenu does not support multiple filters, as it has no way to let the user choose between them as the Gtk::RecentChooserWidget and Gtk::RecentChooserDialog widgets do. Thus using Gtk::RecentChooser#add_filter on a Gtk::RecentChooserMenu widget will yield the same effects as using Gtk::RecentChooser#set_filter, replacing any currently set filter with the supplied filter; Gtk::RecentChooser#remove_filter will remove any currently set Gtk::RecentFilter object and will unset the current filter; Gtk::RecentChooser#filters will return a list containing a single Gtk::RecentFilter object.

Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.

    * manager: a Gtk::RecentManager. This is useful if you have implemented your own recent manager, or if you have a customized instance of a Gtk::RecentManager object or if you wish to share a common Gtk::RecentManager object among multiple Gtk::RecentChooser widgets.
