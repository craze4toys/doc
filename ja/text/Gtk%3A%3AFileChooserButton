= class Gtk::FileChooserButton
The Gtk::FileChooserButton is a widget that lets the user select a file. It includes the Gtk::FileChooser module. Visually, it is a file name with a button to bring up a Gtk::FileChooserDialog. The user can then use that dialog to change the file associated with that button. This widget does not support setting the "select-multiple" property to true. 

=== Example 5. Create a button to let the user select a file in /etc

  button = Gtk::FileChooserButton.new("Select a file", 
                                      Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_OPEN)
  button.current_folder = "/etc"


The Gtk::FileChooserButton supports the ((<GtkFileChooserAction|Gtk::FileChooser#GtkFileChooserAction>))s Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_OPEN and Gtk::FileChooser::ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER. 

:Important
 The Gtk::FileChooserButton will ellipsize the label, and thus will thus request little horizontal space. To give the button more space, you should call Gtk::Widget#size_request, Gtk::FileChooserButton#width_chars=, or pack the button in such a way that other interface elements give space to the widget.
