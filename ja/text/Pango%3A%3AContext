== Class Methods
--- Pango::Context.new
    Creates a new Pango::Context initialized to default value. 
    This method is only useful when implementing a new backend for Pango, something applications won't do. 
    If you are using Pango as part of a higher-level system, that system may have it's own ways of create a Pango::Context. For instance, the GTK+ toolkit has, among others, Gdk::Pango.context, and Gtk::Widget#pango_context.
    * Returns: the new Pango::Context  


== Instance Methods
--- font_map
    Gets the Pango::Fontmap used to look up fonts for this context. ((* Sinece 1.6 *))
    * Returns : the font map for the Pango::Context. This value is owned by Pango and should not be unreferenced.  
--- font_map=(font_map)
    Sets the font map to be searched when fonts are looked-up in this context. This is only for internal use by Pango backends, a Pango::Context obtained via one of the recommended methods should already have a suitable font map.
    * font_map: the Pango::FontMap to set.  
    * Returns: font_map
--- set_font_map(font_map)
    Same as Pango::Context#font_map=.
    * font_map: the Pango::FontMap to set.

== Constants
=== Direction
The Pango::Context::Direction class represents a direction in the Unicode bidirectional algorithm; not every value in this enumeration makes sense for every usage of Pango::Context::Direction; for example, the return value of Pango.unichar_direction and Pango.find_base_dir cannot be Pango::Context::DIRECTION_WEAK_LTR or Pango::Context::DIRECTION_WEAK_RTL, since every character is either neutral or has a strong direction; on the other hand Pango::Context::DIRECTION_NEUTRAL doesn't make sense to pass to Pango.log2vis_get_embedding_levels. 

The Pango::Context::DIRECTION_TTB_LTR, Pango::Context::DIRECTION_TTB_RTL values come from an earlier interpretation of this enumeration as the writing direction of a block of text and are no longer used; See the Text module of the CSS3 spec for how vertical text is planned to be handled in a future version of Pango. The explanation of why Pango::Context::DIRECTION_TTB_LTR is treated as Pango::Context::DIRECTION_RTL can be found there as well.

Notice: You can omit "Context::" like as Pango::DIRECTION_LTR instead of Pango::Context::DIRECTION_LTR.

--- DIRECTION_LTR
    A strong left-to-right direction 
--- DIRECTION_RTL
    A strong right-to-left direction 
--- DIRECTION_TTB_LTR
    Deprecated value; treated the same as Pango::DIRECTION_RTL
--- DIRECTION_TTB_RTL
    Deprecated value; treated the same as Pango::DIRECTION_LTR
--- DIRECTION_WEAK_LTR
    A weak left-to-right direction 
--- DIRECTION_WEAK_RTL
    A weak right-to-left direction
--- DIRECTION_NEUTRAL
    No direction specified
